Before embarking on a new translation project, we ask that you review the \nupdated information below\n-- the process has changed a little bit.\n\n\n\n\nContributing to the Sails docs\n#\n\n\nWe welcome your help!

Please post to the Google Group with your ideas- or if you're interested in helping directly, contact @fancydoilies, @rudeboot, or @mikermcneil on Twitter.\n\n\nWhat branch should I edit?\n#\n\n\nThat depends on what kind of edit you are making.  Most often, you'll be making an edit that is relevant for the latest stable version of Sails (i.e. the version on \nNPM\n) and so you'll want to edit the \nmaster\n branch of \nthis\n repo (what you see in the sails-docs repo by default).  The docs team merges master into the appropriate branch for the latest stable release of Sails, and then deploys that to sailsjs.org about once per week.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you are making an edit related to an unreleased feature in an upcoming version; most commonly as an accompaniment a feature proposal or open pull request to Sails or a related project, then you will want to edit the branch for the next, unreleased version of Sails (sometimes called \"edge\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch (in \nsails-docs\n)\n\n\nDocumentation for Sails Version...\n\n\nPreview At...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nUpcoming v1.0 release\n\n\nnext.sailsjs.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaster\n\n\n\n\npreview.sailsjs.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.12\n\n\nSails v0.12.x\n\n\nsailsjs.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.11\n\n\nSails v0.11.x\n\n\n0.11.sailsjs.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these docs compiled and pushed to the website?\n#\n\n\nWe use a module called \ndoc-templater\n to convert the .md files to the html for the website. You can learn more about how it works in \nthe doc-templater repo\n.\n\n\nEach .md file has its own page on the website (i.e. all reference, concepts, and anatomy files), and should include a special \n<docmeta name=\"displayName\">\n tag with a \nvalue\n property specifying the title for the page.  This will impact how the doc page appears in search engine results, and it will also be used as its display name in the navigation menu on sailsjs.org.  For example:\n\n\n<docmeta name=\"displayName\" value=\"Building Custom Homemade Puddings\">\n\n\n\n\nWhen will my change appear on the Sails website?\n#\n\n\nDocumentation changes go live when they are merged onto a special branch corresponding with the current stable version of Sails (e.g. 0.12). We cannot merge pull requests sent directly to this branch-- its sole purpose is to reflect the content currently hosted on sailsjs.org, and content is only merged just before redeploying the sails website.\n\n\nIf you want to see how documentation changes will appear on sailsjs.org, you can visit \npreview.sailsjs.org\n. The preview site updates itself automatically as changes are merged into the master branch of sails-docs.\n\n\nHow can I help translate the documentation?\n#\n\n\nA great way to help the Sails project, especially if you speak a language other than English natively, is to volunteer to translate the Sails documentation.  If you are interested in collaborating with any of the translation projects listed in the table above, contact the maintainer of the translation project using the instructions in the README of that fork.\n\n\nIf your language is not represented in the table above, and you are interested in beginning a translation project, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nFork this repo (\nbalderdashy/sails-docs\n) and change the name of your fork to be \nsails-docs-{{IETF}}\n where {{IETF}} is the \nIETF language tag\n for your language.\n\n\nEdit the README to summarize your progress so far, provide any other information you think would be helpful for others reading your translation, and let interested contributors know how to contact you.\n\n\nSend a pull request editing the table above to add a link to your fork.\n\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the first complete version of your translation, open an issue and someone from our docs team will be happy to help you get preview it in the context of the Sails website, get it live on a domain (yours, or a subdomain of sailsjs.org, whichever makes the most sense), and share it with the rest of the Sails community.\n\n\n\n\nHow else can I help?\n#\n\n\nFor more information on contributing to Sails in general, see the \nContribution Guide\n.\n\n\nLicense\n#\n\n\nMIT\n\n\nThe \nSails framework\n is free and open-source under the \nMIT License\n.\n\n\n(And the files in this repo are too.)",

Good news is it's pretty simple:  The compilation process for the Sails docs involves generating HTML from Markdown files in the sails-docs repo, then performing some additional transformations such as adding data type bubbles, tagging permalinks for individual sections of pages, building JSON data to power the side navigation menu and setting HTML \n<title>\n attributes for better search engine discoverability of individual doc pages.  See the \nSails website repo\n for more information.\n\n\nHow do I get involved?\n#\n\n\nThere are many different ways to contibute to Sails; for example you could help us improve the \nofficial documentation\n, write a \nplugin\n, fix a bug on the \nwebsite\n, answer \nStackOverflow questions\n, start a Sails meetup, help troubleshoot GitHub issues, write some tests, or submit a patch to Sails core or one of its dependencies.  Please look through the \ncontribution guide\n before you get started. It's a short read that covers guidelines and best practices that ensure your hard work will have the maximum impact.\n\n\nWhere do I submit ideas?  Report issues?\n#\n\n\nThe Sails project tracks bug reports in GitHub issues and uses pull requests for feature proposals.  Please read the \ncontribution guide\n before you create an issue, submit a proposal, or begin working on pull request.\n\n\nWhat version of Sails should I use?\n#\n\n\n\n\nUnless you are a contributor running a pre-release version of the framework in order to do some testing or work on core, you should use the latest stable version of Sails from NPM (click the badge above).  Installing is easy- just follow the instructions on \nthe Sails website\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote: to install/upgrade to the latest version of Sails locally in an existing project, run \nnpm install sails@latest --force\n.  If you are having trouble and are looking for a bazooka, you might also want to run \nrm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install sails@latest --force && npm install\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to install a pre-release version of Sails, you can install from the \nbeta\n tag on npm (i.e. \nnpm install sails@beta\n). This is a great way to try out a coming release ahead of time and start upgrading before the release becomes official.  The beta npm release candidate corresponds with the \nbeta\n branch in the Sails repo.\n\n\nFinally, if you like living on the edge, or you're working on adding a feature or fixing a bug in Sails, install the edge version from the \nmaster\n branch on github.  The edge version is not published on the registry since it's constantly under development, but you can \nstill use npm to install it\n (e.g. \nnpm install sails@git://github.com/balderdashy/sails.git\n)\n\n\nFor more instructions on installing the beta and edge versions of Sails, check out the \ncontribution guide\n.\n\n\nI'm having trouble installing Sails. What should I do?\n#\n\n\nStart with NPM's helpful \ntroubleshooting guide\n.  If you continue to have problems, and you've tried Google searching but you're still stumped, please carefully review the updated Sails \ncontribution guide\n and then create a GitHub issue in the Sails repo.\n\n\nWhat are the dependencies of Sails?\n#\n\n\n\n\nWe have learned again and again over the years to take versioning of dependencies very seriously.  We lock Sails' dependency versions and only bump those versions if the associated updates fix a security issue or present other substantive advantages to Sails users (improved compatibility, performance, etc.)  In addition, the core maintainers of Sails are committed fixing any major security, performance, or stability bugs that arise in any of our core dependencies-- regardless of whether those modules are \nofficially maintained by another entity or not\n.\n\n\nSails is tested with \nnode\n versions 0.10.x and up, and built on the rock-solid foundations of \nExpress\n and \nSocket.io\n.  Out of the box, it also depends on other great modules, like \ngrunt\n, \nwaterline\n, and \nfs-extra\n.  Click the badge above for the full list of dependencies.\n\n\nWhere do I get help?\n#\n\n\nAside from the \nofficial documentation\n, be sure and check out the \nSupport page on the Sails website\n, and pop in to our \nGitter chat room\n.  If you're stumped, make sure and \nask a question on StackOverflow\n, where there's an \nactive Sails community\n.  Members of our core team recently taught a \nfree video course\n on \nPlatzi\n and wrote \na book\n.\n\n\nWho else is using Sails.js?\n#\n\n\n\n\nSails is used in production by individuals and companies, non-profits, and government entities all over the world, for all sorts of projects (greenfield and mature). This small list is definitely not authoritative, so if you're using Sails in your app/product/service, we'd love to hear about it!

Installing is easy- just follow the instructions on  the Sails website .   Note: to install/upgrade to the latest version of Sails locally in an existing project, run  npm install sails@latest --force .  If you are having trouble and are looking for a bazooka, you might also want to run  rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install sails@latest --force && npm install .   If you are looking to install a pre-release version of Sails, you can install from the  beta  tag on npm (i.e.  npm install sails@beta ). This is a great way to try out a coming release ahead of time and start upgrading before the release becomes official.  The beta npm release candidate corresponds with the  beta  branch in the Sails repo.  Finally, if you like living on the edge, or you're working on adding a feature or fixing a bug in Sails, install the edge version from the  master  branch on github.  The edge version is not published on the registry since it's constantly under development, but you can  still use npm to install it  (e.g.  npm install sails@git://github.com/balderdashy/sails.git )  For more instructions on installing the beta and edge versions of Sails, check out the  contribution guide .",

Sails is tested with  node  versions 0.10.x and up, and built on the rock-solid foundations of  Express  and  Socket.io .

The Grunt integration is mainly useful for bundling front-end assets, (like stylesheets, scripts, & markup templates) but it can also be used to run all kinds of development tasks, from browserify compilation to database migrations.\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, read on!\n\n\n### How does this work?\n\nThe asset pipeline bundled in Sails is a set of Grunt tasks configured with conventional defaults designed to make your project more consistent and productive.\n\nThe entire front-end asset workflow in Sails is completely customizable-- while it provides some suggestions out of the box, Sails makes no pretense that it can anticipate all of the needs you'll encounter building the browser-based/front-end portion of your application.  Who's to say you're even building an app for a browser?\n\n\n\n### What tasks does Sails run automatically?\n\nSails runs some of these tasks (the ones in the `tasks/register` folder) automatically when you run certain commands.\n\n###### `sails lift`\n\nRuns the `default` task (`tasks/register/default.js`).\n\n###### `sails lift --prod`\n\nRuns the `prod` task (`tasks/register/prod.js`).\n\n###### `sails www`\n\nRuns the `build` task (`tasks/register/build.js`).\n\n###### `sails www --prod` (production)\n\nRuns the `buildProd` task (`tasks/register/buildProd.js`).\n\n\n### Can I customize this for SASS, Angular, client-side Jade templates, etc?\n\nYou can modify, omit, or replace any of these Grunt tasks to fit your requirements. You can also add your own Grunt tasks- just add a `someTask.js` file in the `grunt/config` directory to configure the new task, then register it with the appropriate parent task(s) (see files in `grunt/register/*.js`).\n\n\n### Do I have to use Grunt?\n\nNope! To disable Grunt integration in Sails, just delete your Gruntfile or disable the Grunt hook.\n\n\n### What if I'm not building a web frontend?\n\nThat's ok! A core tenet of Sails is client-agnosticism-- it's especially designed for building APIs used by all sorts of clients; native Android/iOS/Cordova, serverside SDKs, etc.\n\nYou can completely disable Grunt by following the instructions above.\n\nIf you still want to use Grunt for other purposes, but don't want any of the default web front-end stuff, just delete your project's `assets` folder and remove the front-end oriented tasks from the `grunt/register` and `grunt/config` folders.  You can also run `sails new myCoolApi --no-frontend` to omit the `assets` folder and front-end-oriented Grunt tasks for future projects.

This can be brought into your HTML via a  <script>  tag in order to expose your templates as  window.JST  for use in your client-side JavaScript.  In other words, this takes HTML files in  assets/templates/  and turns them into tiny little javascript functions that return HTML strings when you pass a data dictionary into them.  This approach is called \"precompiling\", and it can considerably speed up template rendering on the client, and even reduce bandwidth usage and related expenses.)   Note that, by default, Underscore/Lodash/JST notation is  opposite  from EJS ( <%=  is  <%- , and vice versa).\nIf this bothers you, it can be easily configured in this file.

logic for your needs in `config/500.js`\n\n  Sails considers a request in a \"500: Server Error\" state when\n  your app throws a catchable error (not inside of an asynchronous callback).\n\n  You can also trigger this response from one of your controllers or policies with:\n  `return res.serverError( e );`\n  (where `e` is an optional message, error, or array of errors to include in the response)\n\n-->\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Server Error</title>\n    <link href='http://sailsjs.org/styles/fonts.css' rel='stylesheet'/>\n    <style>\n    /* Styles included inline since you'll

It is this file that is actually sent to the client.  \n\n\nFeel free to change this as you see fit.  Its also a great place to include javascript and css that you plan on using in every view.  This keeps you from having to include them in all your custom .ejs files.  Note, this isnt an issue if you created your app with the \n--linker\n flag.  In this case, everything in your assets directory is minified and injected into every view rendered by your app. \n\n\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>New Sails App</title>\n\n    <!-- Viewport mobile tag for sensible mobile support -->\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\">\n\n\n    <!--  \n        Stylesheets and Preprocessors\n        ==============================\n\n        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously\n        using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).

In Sails, these files are placed in the \nassets/\n folder.  When you lift your app, add files to your \nassets/\n folder, or change existing assets, Sails' built-in asset pipeline processes and syncs those files to a hidden folder (\n.tmp/public/\n).\n\n\n\n\nThis intermediate step (moving files from \nassets/\n into \n.tmp/public/\n) allows Sails to pre-process assets for use on the client - things like LESS, CoffeeScript, SASS, spritesheets, Jade templates, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of this \n.tmp/public\n folder are what Sails actually serves at runtime.  This is roughly equivalent to the \"public\" folder in \nexpress\n, or the \nwww/\n folder you might be familiar with from other web servers like Apache.\n\n\nStatic middleware\n#\n\n\nBehind the scenes, Sails uses the \nstatic middleware\n from Express to serve your assets. You can configure this middleware (e.g. cache settings) in \n/config/http.js\n.\n\n\nindex.html\n#\n\n\nLike most web servers, Sails honors the \nindex.html\n convention.

So if you define a \ncustom route\n, but also have a file in your assets directory with a conflicting path, the custom route will intercept the request before it reaches the static middleware.

Only the \nassets/styles/importer.less\n is compiled.

Also automatically links an output file containing precompiled templates using a \n<script>\n tag. A much more detailed description of this task can be found \nhere\n, but the big takeaway is that script and stylesheet injection is \nonly\n done in files containing \n<!--SCRIPTS--><!--SCRIPTS END-->\n and/or \n<!--STYLES--><!--STYLES END-->\n tags.  These are included in the default \nviews/layout.ejs\n file in a new Sails project.  If you don't want to use the linker for your project, you can simply remove those tags.\n\n\nusage docs\n\n\n\n\nsync\n#\n\n\n\n\nA grunt task to keep directories in sync. It is very similar to grunt-contrib-copy but tries to copy only those files that have actually changed. It specifically synchronizes files from the \nassets/\n folder to \n.tmp/public/\n, overwriting anything that's already there.\n\n\nusage docs\n\n\n\n\nuglify\n#\n\n\n\n\nMinifies client-side javascript assets.  Note that by default, this task will \"mangle\" all of your function and variable names (either by changing them to a much shorter name, or stripping them entirely).  This is usually desirable as it makes your code significantly smaller, but in some cases can lead to unexpected results (particularly when you expect an object's constructor to have a certain name).  To turn off or modify this behavior, \nuse the \nmangle\n option\n when setting up this task.\n\n\nusage docs\n\n\n\n\nwatch\n#\n\n\n\n\nRuns predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted. Watches for changes on files in the \nassets/\n folder, and re-runs the appropriate tasks (e.g. less and jst compilation).

If someone hasn't already built what you need, you can always \nauthor\n and \npublish your own Grunt plugin\n to \nnpm\n!\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't used \nGrunt\n before, be sure to check out the \nGetting Started\n guide, as it explains how to create a \nGruntfile\n as well as install and use Grunt plugins.\n\n\n\n\nAsset pipeline\n#\n\n\nThe asset pipeline is the place where you will organize the assets that will be injected into your views, and it can be found in the \ntasks/pipeline.js\n file. Configuring these assets is simple and uses grunt \ntask file configuration\n and \nwildcard/glob/splat patterns\n. They are broken down into three sections.\n\n\nCSS Files to Inject\n#\n\n\nThis is an array of css files to be injected into your html as \n<link>\n tags.  These tags will be injected between the \n<!--STYLES--><!--STYLES END-->\n comments in any view in which they appear.\n\n\nJavascript Files to Inject\n#\n\n\nThis is an array of Javascript files that gets injected into your html as \n<script>\n tags.  These tags will be injected between the \n<!--SCRIPTS--><!--SCRIPTS END-->\n comments in any view in which they appear. The files get injected in the order they are in the array (i.e. you should place the path of dependencies before the file that depends on them.)\n\n\nTemplate Files to Inject\n#\n\n\nThis is an array of html files that will compiled to a jst function and placed in a jst.js file. This file then gets injected as a \n<script>\n tag in between the \n<!--TEMPLATES--><!--TEMPLATES END-->\n comments in your html.\n\n\n\n\nThe same grunt wildcard/glob/splat patterns and task file configuration are used in some of the task configuration js files themselves if you would like to change those too.\n\n\n\n\nTask configuration\n#\n\n\nConfigured tasks are the set of rules your Gruntfile will follow when run. They are completely customizable and are located in the \ntasks/config/\n directory. You can modify, omit, or replace any of these Grunt tasks to fit your requirements. You can also add your own Grunt tasks- just add a \nsomeTask.js\n file in this directory to configure the new task, then register it with the appropriate parent task(s) (see files in \ntasks/register/*.js\n). Remember, Sails comes with a set of useful default tasks that are designed to get you up and running with no configuration required.\n\n\nConfiguring a custom task.\n#\n\n\nConfiguring a custom task into your project is very simple and uses Grunt\u2019s \nconfig\n and \ntask\n APIs to allow you to make your task modular. Let\u2019s go through a quick example of creating a new task that replaces an existing task. Let\u2019s say we want to use the \nHandlebars\n templating engine instead of the underscore templating engine that comes configured by default:\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to install the handlebars grunt plugin using the following command in your terminal:\n\n\n\n\nnpm install grunt-contrib-handlebars --save-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a configuration file at \ntasks/config/handlebars.js\n. This is where we\u2019ll put our handlebars configuration.\n\n\n\n\n// tasks/config/handlebars.js\n// --------------------------------\n// handlebar task configuration.\n\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) {\n\n  // We use the grunt.config api's set method to configure an\n  // object to the defined string. In this case the task\n  // 'handlebars' will be configured based on the object below.\n  grunt.config.set('handlebars', {\n    dev: {\n      // We will define which template files to inject\n      // in tasks/pipeline.js\n      files: {\n        '.tmp/public/templates.js': require('../pipeline').templateFilesToInject\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  // load npm module for handlebars.\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-handlebars');\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the path to source files in asset pipeline. The only change here will be that handelbars looks for files with the extension .hbs while underscore templates can be in simple html files.\n\n\n\n\n// tasks/pipeline.js\n// --------------------------------\n// asset pipeline\n\nvar cssFilesToInject = [\n  'styles/**/*.css'\n];\n\nvar jsFilesToInject = [\n  'js/socket.io.js',\n  'js/sails.io.js',\n  'js/connection.example.js',\n  'js/**/*.js'\n];\n\n// We change this glob pattern to include all files in\n// the templates/ direcotry that end in the extension .hbs\nvar templateFilesToInject = [\n  'templates/**/*.hbs'\n];\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  cssFilesToInject: cssFilesToInject.map(function(path) {\n    return '.tmp/public/' + path;\n  }),\n  jsFilesToInject: jsFilesToInject.map(function(path) {\n    return '.tmp/public/' + path;\n  }),\n  templateFilesToInject: templateFilesToInject.map(function(path) {\n    return 'assets/' + path;\n  })\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude the handlebars task into the compileAssets and syncAssets registered tasks. This is where the jst task was being used and we are going to replace it with the newly configured handlebars task.\n\n\n\n\n// tasks/register/compileAssets.js\n// --------------------------------\n// compile assets registered grunt task\n\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n  grunt.registerTask('compileAssets', [\n    'clean:dev',\n    'handlebars:dev',       // changed jst task to handlebars task\n    'less:dev',\n    'copy:dev',\n    'coffee:dev'\n  ]);\n};\n\n// tasks/register/syncAssets.js\n// --------------------------------\n// synce assets registered grunt task\n\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n  grunt.registerTask('syncAssets', [\n    'handlebars:dev',      // changed jst task to handlebars task\n    'less:dev',\n    'sync:dev',\n    'coffee:dev'\n  ]);\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove jst task config file. We are no longer using it so we can get rid of \ntasks/config/jst.js\n. Simply delete it from your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally you should delete it from your project and your project's node dependencies. This can be done by running this command in your terminal.\n\n\n\n\nnpm uninstall grunt-contrib-jst --save-dev\n\n\n\n\nTask triggers\n#\n\n\nIn \ndevelopment mode\n, Sails runs the \ndefault\n task (\ntasks/register/default.js\n).  This compiles LESS, CoffeeScript, and client-side JST templates, then links to them automatically from your app's dynamic views and static HTML pages.\n\n\nIn production, Sails runs the \nprod\n task (\ntasks/register/prod.js\n) which shares the same duties as \ndefault\n, but also minifies your app's scripts and stylesheets.  This reduces your application's load time and bandwidth usage.\n\n\nThese task triggers are \n\"basic\" Grunt tasks\n located in the \ntasks/register/\n folder.  Below, you'll find the complete reference of all task triggers in Sails, and the command which kicks them off:\n\n\nsails lift\n#\n\n\nRuns the \ndefault\n task (\ntasks/register/default.js\n).\n\n\nsails lift --prod\n#\n\n\nRuns the \nprod\n task (\ntasks/register/prod.js\n).\n\n\nsails www\n#\n\n\nRuns the \nbuild\n task (\ntasks/register/build.js\n) that compiles all the assets to \nwww\n subfolder instead of \n.tmp/public\n using relative paths in references. This allows serving static content with Apache or Nginx instead of relying on \n'www middleware'\n.\n\n\nsails www --prod\n (production)\n#\n\n\nRuns the \nbuildProd\n task (\ntasks/register/buildProd.js\n) that does the same as \nbuild\n task but also optimizes assets.\n\n\nYou may run other tasks by specifying setting NODE_ENV and creating a task list in tasks/register/ with the same name.

For instance, if you have a  User.js  model and an empty  UserController.js  controller,  find ,  create ,  update ,  destroy ,  populate ,  add  and  remove  actions exist implicitly, without you having to write them.  By default, the blueprint RESTful routes and shortcut routes are bound to their corresponding blueprint actions.  However, any blueprint action can be overridden for a particular controller by creating a custom action in that controller file (e.g.  ParrotController.find ).  Alternatively, you can override the blueprint action  everywhere in your app  by creating your own custom blueprint action. (e.g.  api/blueprints/create.js ).  The current version of Sails ships with the following blueprint actions:   find  findOne  create  update  destroy  populate  add  remove   For more information about blueprints, including how to disable and override them, see the  Blueprint API reference",

Head over to \nReference > Configuration\n to see a complete guide to all configuration options available in Sails.\n\n\n\n\nSails apps can be \nconfigured programmatically\n, by specifying \nenvironment variables\n or command-line arguments, by changing the local or global \n.sailsrc\n files\n, or (most commonly) using the boilerplate configuration files conventionally located in the \nconfig/\n folder of new projects. The authoritative, merged-together configuration used in your app is available at runtime on the \nsails\n global as \nsails.config\n.\n\n\nStandard configuration files (\nconfig/*\n)\n#\n\n\nA number of configuration files are generated in new Sails apps by default.  These boilerplate files include a number of inline comments, which are designed to provide a quick, on-the-fly reference without having to jump back and forth between the docs and your text editor.\n\n\nIn most cases, the top-level keys on the \nsails.config\n object (e.g. \nsails.config.views\n) correspond to a particular configuration file (e.g. \nconfig/views.js\n) in your app; however configuration settings may be arranged however you like across the files in your \nconfig/\n directory.  The important part is the name (i.e. key) of the setting- not the file it came from.\n\n\nFor instance, let's say you add a new file, \nconfig/foo.js\n:\n\n\n// config/foo.js\n// The object below will be merged into `sails.config.blueprints`:\nmodule.exports.blueprints = {\n  shortcuts: false\n};\n\n\n\n\nFor an exhaustive reference of individual configuration options, and the file they live in by default, check out the reference pages in this section, or take a look at \n\"\nconfig/\n\"\n in \nThe Anatomy of a Sails App\n for a higher-level overview.\n\n\nEnvironment-specific files (\nconfig/env/*\n)\n#\n\n\nSettings specified in the standard configuration files will generally be available in all environments (i.e. development, production, test, etc.).  If you'd like to have some settings take effect only in certain environments, you can use the special environment-specific files and folders:\n\n\n\n\nAny files saved under the \n/config/env/<environment-name>\n folder will be loaded \nonly\n when Sails is lifted in the \n<environment-name>\n environment.  For example, files saved under \nconfig/env/production\n will only be loaded when Sails is lifted in production mode.\n\n\nAny files saved as \nconfig/env/<environment-name>.js\n will be loaded \nonly\n when Sails is lifted in the \n<environment-name>\n environment, and will be merged on top of any settings loaded from the environment-specific subfolder.  For example, settings in \nconfig/env/production.js\n will take precedence over those in the files in the  \nconfig/env/production\n folder.  \n\n\n\n\nBy default, your app runs in the \"development\" environment.  The recommended approach for changing your app's environment is by using the \nNODE_ENV\n environment variable:\n\n\nNODE_ENV=production node app.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nproduction\n environment is special-- depending on your configuration, it enables compression, caching, minification, etc. \n\n\nAlso note that if you are using \nconfig/local.js\n, the configuration exported in that file takes precedence over environment-specific configuration files.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfig/local.js\n file\n#\n\n\nYou may use the \nconfig/local.js\n file to configure a Sails app for your local environment (your laptop, for example).  The settings in this file take precedence over all other config files except \n.sailsrc\n.  Since they're intended only for local use, they should not be put under version control (and are included in the default \n.gitignore\n file for that reason).  Use \nlocal.js\n to store local database settings, change the port used when lifting an app on your computer, etc.\n\n\nSee \nhttp://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/Configuration/localjsfile.html\n for more information.\n\n\nAccessing \nsails.config\n in your app\n#\n\n\nThe \nconfig\n object is available on the Sails app instance (\nsails\n).  By default, this is exposed on the \nglobal scope\n during lift, and therefore available from anywhere in your app.\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\n// This example checks that, if we are in production mode, csrf is enabled.\n// It throws an error and crashes the app otherwise.\nif (sails.config.environment === 'production' && !sails.config.csrf) {\n  throw new Error('STOP IMMEDIATELY ! CSRF should always be enabled in a production deployment!');\n}\n\n\n\n\nSetting \nsails.config\n values directly using environment variables\n#\n\n\nIn addition to using configuration \nfiles\n, you can set individual configuration values on the command line when you lift Sails by prefixing the config key names with \nsails_\n, and separating nested key names with double-underscores (\n__\n).  For example, you could do the following to set the \nCORS origin\n (\nsails.config.cors.origin\n) to \"http://somedomain.com\" on the command line:\n\n\nsails_cors__origin=\"http://somedomain.com\" sails lift\n\n\n\n\nThis value will be in effect \nonly\n for the lifetime of this particular Sails instance, and will override any values in the configuration files.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of special exceptions to the rule: \nNODE_ENV\n and \nPORT\n.\n+ \nNODE_ENV\n is a convention for any Node.js app.  When set to \n'production'\n, it sets \nsails.config.environment\n. \n+ Similarly, \nPORT\n is just another way to set \nsails.config.port\n.  This is strictly for convenience and backwards compatibility.\n\n\nHere's a relatively common example where you might use both of these environment variables at the same time:\n\n\nbash\nPORT=443 NODE_ENV=production sails lift\n\n\n\n\nCustom Configuration\n#\n\n\nSails recognizes many different settings, namespaced under different top level keys (e.g. \nsails.config.sockets\n and \nsails.config.blueprints\n).  However you can also use \nsails.config\n for your own custom configuration (e.g. \nsails.config.someProprietaryAPI.secret\n).\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\n// config/linkedin.js\nmodule.exports.linkedin = {\n  apiKey: '...',\n  apiSecret: '...'\n};\n\n\n\n\n// In your controller/service/model/hook/whatever:\n// ...\nvar apiKey = sails.config.linkedin.apiKey;\nvar apiSecret = sails.config.linkedin.apiSecret;\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the \nsails\n Command-Line Interface\n#\n\n\nWhen it comes to configuration, most of the time you'll be focused on managing the runtime settings for a particular app: the port, database connections, and so forth.  However it can also be useful to customize the Sails CLI itself; to simplify your workflow, reduce repetitive tasks, perform custom build automation, etc.  Thankfully, Sails v0.10 added a powerful new tool to do just that.\n\n\nThe \n.sailsrc\n file\n is unique from other configuration sources in Sails in that it may also be used to configure the Sails CLI-- either system-wide, for a group of directories, or only when you are \ncd\n'ed into a particular folder.  The main reason to do this is to customize the \ngenerators\n that are used when \nsails generate\n and \nsails new\n are run, but it can also be useful to install your own custom generators or apply hard-coded config overrides.\n\n\nAnd since Sails will look for the \"nearest\" \n.sailsrc\n in the ancestor directories of the current working directory, you can safely use this file to configure sensitive settings you can't check in to your cloud-hosted code repository (\nlike your \ndatabase password\n.)  Just include a \n.sailsrc\n file in your \"$HOME\" directory.  See \nthe docs on \n.sailsrc\n files for more information.\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in meaning of the settings in \nsails.config\n are, in some cases, only interpreted by Sails during the \"lift\" process.  In other words, changing some options at runtime will have no effect.  To change the port your app is running on, for instance, you can't just change \nsails.config.port\n-- you'll need to change or override the setting in a configuration file or as a command-line argument, etc., then restart the server.",

They often act as a middleman between your \nmodels\n and \nviews\n. For many applications, the controllers will contain the bulk of your project\u2019s \nbusiness logic\n.\n\n\nActions\n#\n\n\nControllers are comprised of a set of methods called \nactions\n (or sometimes \"controller actions\").  Actions are bound to \nroutes\n in your application, so that when a client requests the route, the action is executed to perform some business logic and send a response.  For example, the \nGET /hello\n route in your application could be bound to an action like:\n\n\nfunction (req, res) {\n  return res.send('Hi there!');\n}\n\n\n\n\nAny time a web browser is pointed to the \n/hello\n URL on your app's server, the page will display the message: \u201cHi there\u201d.\n\n\nWhere are controllers defined?\n#\n\n\nControllers are defined in the \napi/controllers/\n folder. You can put any files you like in that folder, but in order for them to be loaded by Sails as controllers, a file must \nend\n in \nController.js\n.  By convention, Sails controllers are usually \nPascal-cased\n, so that every word in the filename (including the first word) is capitalized: for example, \nUserController.js\n, \nMyController.js\n and \nSomeGreatBigController.js\n are all valid, Pascal-cased names.\n\n\n\n\nYou may organize your controllers into groups by saving them in subfolders of \napi/controllers\n, however note that the subfolder name \nwill become part of the Controller\u2019s identity\n when used for routing (more on that in the \"Routing\" section below).\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a controller file look like?\n#\n\n\nA controller file defines a Javascript dictionary (aka \"plain object\") whose keys are action names, and whose values are the corresponding action methods.  Here\u2019s a simple example of a full controller file:\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  hi: function (req, res) {\n    return res.send('Hi there!');\n  },\n  bye: function (req, res) {\n    return res.redirect('http://www.sayonara.com');\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nThis controller defines two actions: \nhi\n and \nbye\n.  The \nhi\n action responds to a request with a string message, while the \nbye\n action responds by redirecting to another web site.  The \nreq\n and \nres\n objects will be familiar to anyone who has used \nExpress.js\n to write a web application.  This is by design, as Sails uses Express under the hood to handle routing.  Take special note, however, of the lack of a \nnext\n argument for the actions.  Unlike Express  middleware methods, Sails controller actions should always be the last stop in the request chain--that is, they should always result in either a response or an error.  While it is technically possible to use \nnext\n in an action method, you are strongly encouraged to use \npolicies\n instead wherever possible.\n\n\n\"Thin\" Controllers\n#\n\n\nMost MVC frameworks recommend writing \"thin\" controllers, and while Sails is no exception (it is a good idea to keep your Sails controllers as simple as possible) it is also helpful to understand \"why?\"\n\n\nController code is inherently dependent on some sort of trigger or event.  In a backend framework like Sails, this event is always an incoming request.  So if you write a bunch of code in one of your controller actions, it is not uncommon for that code's scope to be dependent on the \"request habitat\" (the \nreq\n and \nres\n objects).  Which is fine...until you want to use that code from a slightly different action, or from the command line.\n\n\nSo the goal of the \"thin controller\" philosophy is to encourage decoupling of reusable code from any related scope entanglements.  In Sails, you can achieve this in a number of different ways, but the most common strategies for extrapolating code from controllers are:\n\n\n\n\nWrite a helper function or machine and expose it as a \nservice\n.

Or are you using a custom logger from NPM like \nWinston\n?\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Your App For Production\n#\n\n\nYou can provide configuration which only applies in production in a \nfew different ways\n.  Most apps find themselves using a mix of environment variables and \nconfig/env/production.js\n.  But regardless of how you go about it, this section and the \nScaling section\n of the documentation cover the configuration settings you should review and/or change before going to production.\n\n\nDeploying On a Single Server\n#\n\n\nNode.js is pretty darn fast.  For many apps, one server is enough to handle the expected traffic-- at least at first.\n\n\n\n\nThis section focuses on \nsingle-server Sails deployment\n.  This kind of deployment is inherently limited in scale.  See \nScaling\n for information about deploying your Sails/Node app behind a load balancer.\n\n\n\n\nMany teams decide to deploy their production app behind a load balancer or proxy (e.g. in a PaaS like Heroku or Modulus, or behind an nginx server).  This is often the right approach since it helps future-proof your app in case your scalability needs change and you need to add more servers.  If you are using a load balancer or proxy, there are a few things in the list below that you can ignore:\n\n\n\n\ndon't worry about configuring Sails to use an SSL certificate.  SSL will almost always be resolved at your load balancer/proxy server, or by your PaaS provider.\n\n\nyou \nprobably\n don't need to worry about setting your app to run on port 80 (if not behind a proxy like nginx). Most PaaS providers automatically figure out the port for you.  If you are using a proxy server, please refer to its documentation (whether or not you need to configure the port for your Sails app depends on how you set things up and can vary widely based on your needs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your app uses sockets and you're using nginx, be sure to configure it to relay websocket messages to your server. You can find guidance on proxying WebSockets in \nnginx's docs on the subject\n.\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nNODE_ENV\n environment variable to \n'production'\n#\n\n\nConfiguring your app's environment config to \n'production'\n tells Sails to get its game face on; i.e. that your app is running in a production environment.  This is, hands down, the most important step. If you only have the time to change \none setting\n before deploying your Sails app, \nthis should be that setting\n!\n\n\nWhen your app is running in a production environment:\n  + Middleware and other dependencies baked into Sails switch to using more efficient code.\n  + All of your \nmodels' migration settings\n are forced to \nmigrate: 'safe'\n.  This is a failsafe to protect against inadvertently damaging your production data during deployment.\n  + Your asset pipeline runs in production mode (if relevant).  Out of the box, that means your Sails app will compile all stylesheets, client-side scripts, and precompiled JST templates into minified \n.css\n and \n.js\n files to decrease page load times and reduce bandwidth consumption.\n  + Error messages and stack traces from \nres.serverError()\n will still be logged, but will not be sent in the response (this is to prevent a would-be attacker from accessing any sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords or the path where your Sails app is located on the server's file system)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nIf you set \nsails.config.environment\n to \n'production'\n some other way, that's totally cool.  Just note that Sails will set the \nNODE_ENV\n environment variable to \n'production'\n for you automatically.  The reason this environment variable is so important is that it is a universal convention in Node.js, regardless of the framework you are using.  Built-in middleware and dependencies in Sails \nexpect\n \nNODE_ENV\n to be set in production-- otherwise they use their less efficient code paths that were designed for development use only.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure your app to run on port 80\n#\n\n\nWhether it's by using the \nsails_port\n environment variable, setting the \n--port\n command-line option, or changing your production config file(s), add the following to the top level of your Sails config:\n\n\nport: 80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, ignore this step if your app will be running behind a load balancer or proxy.\n\n\n\n\nSet up production database(s) for your models\n#\n\n\nTo set up one or more production databases, configure them in \nsails.config.connections\n, and then refer to them from \nsails.config.models.connection\n and/or from individual models.  For most apps, your production config changes are pretty simple:\n1. add a connection representing your production database (e.g. \nproductionPostgresql: { ... }\n)\n2. override the default connection (\nsails.config.models.connection\n) to point to your production database (e.g. \nproductionPostgresql\n)\n\n\nIf your app is using more than one database, your process will be similar.  However, you will probably find that it's easier to override existing connection settings rather than adding new connections and changing individual models to point at them. Regardless how you go about it, if you are using multiple databases you should be sure your models are pointed at the right connections when you deploy to production.\n\n\nKeep in mind that if you are using version control (e.g. git), then any sensitive credentials (such as database passwords) will be checked in to the repo if you include them in your app's configuration files.  A common solution to this problem is to provide certain sensitive configuration settings as environment variables.  See \nConfiguration\n for more information.\n\n\nIf you are using a relational database such as MySQL, there is an additional step.  Remember how Sails sets all your models to \nmigrate:safe\n when run in production?  That means no auto-migrations are run when lifting the app...which means by default your tables won't exist.  A common approach to deal with this during the first-time setup of a relational database for your Sails app goes as follows:\n  + Create the database on the production database server (e.g. \nfrenchfryparty\n)\n  + Configure your app locally to use this production database, but \ndon't set the environment to \n'production'\n, and leave your models' configuration set to \nmigrate: 'alter'\n.  Now run \nsails lift\n \nonce\n-- and when the local server finishes lifting, kill it.\n    + \nBe careful!\n  You should only do this when there is \nno data\n in the production database.\n\n\nIf this makes you nervous or if you can't connect to the production database remotely, you can skip the steps above.  Instead, simply dump your local schema and import it into the production database.\n\n\nEnable CSRF protection\n#\n\n\nProtecting against CSRF is an important security measure for Sails apps.  If you haven't already been developing with CSRF protection enabled (see \nsails.config.csrf\n), be sure to \nenable CSRF protection\n before going to production.\n\n\nEnable SSL\n#\n\n\nIf your API or website does anything that requires authentication, you should use SSL in production.  To configure your Sails app to use an SSL certificate, use \nsails.config.ssl\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, ignore this step if your app will be running behind a load balancer or proxy.\n\n\n\n\nLift Your App\n#\n\n\nThe last step of deployment is actually starting the server.  For example:\n\n\nNODE_ENV=production node app.js\n\n\n\n\nOr if you're more comfortable with command-line options you can use \n--prod\n:\n\n\nnode app.js --prod\n# (Sails will set `NODE_ENV` automatically)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, instead of \nsails lift\n you should start your Sails app with \nnode app.js\n in production.  This way, your app does not rely on having access to the \nsails\n command-line tool; it just runs the \napp.js\n file bundled in your Sails app (which does exactly the same thing).\n\n\n...And Keep It Lifted\n#\n\n\nUnless you are not deploying to a PaaS like Heroku or Modulus, you will want to use a tool like \npm2\n or \nforever\n to make sure your app server will start back up if it crashes.  Regardless of the daemon you choose, you'll want to make sure that it starts the server as described above.\n\n\nFor convenience, here are example lift commands for both \npm2\n and \nforever\n:\n\n\nUsing \npm2\n:\n\n\npm2 start app.js -x -- --prod\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nforever\n:\n\n\nforever start app.js --prod",

Like any Node app, your environment variables are available as \nprocess.env\n.\n\n\nSails also comes with built-in support for creating your own custom configuration settings that will be exposed directly on \nsails.config\n.  And whether custom or built-in, any of the configuration properties in \nsails.config\n can be overridden using environment variables.  See the conceptual documentation on \nConfiguration\n for details.\n\n\nWhere do I put my production database credentials?  Other settings?\n#\n\n\nThe easiest way to add configuration to your Sails app is by modifying the files in \nconfig/\n or adding new ones. Sails supports environment-specific configuration loading out of the box, so you can use \nconfig/env/production.js\n.  Again, see the conceptual documentation on \nConfiguration\n for details.\n\n\nBut sometimes, you don't want to check certain configuration information in to your repository.  \nThe best place to put this kind of configuration is in environment variables.\n\n\nThat said, for development (e.g. on your laptop) using environment variables can sometimes be kind of awkward.  So for your other deployment/machine-specific settings, namely any kind of credentials you want to keep private, you can also use your \nconfig/local.js\n file.  This file is included in your \n.gitignore\n file by default-- this helps prevent you from inadvertently commiting your credentials to your code repository.\n\n\nconfig/local.js\n\n\n// Local configuration\n// \n// Included in the .gitignore by default,\n// this is where you include configuration overrides for your local system\n// or for a production deployment.\n//\n// For example, to use port 80 on the local machine, override the `port` config\nmodule.exports = {\n    port: 80,\n    environment: 'production',\n    adapters: {\n        mysql: {\n            user: 'root',\n            password: '12345'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nHow do I get my Sails app on the server?\n#\n\n\nIf you are using a Paas like Heroku or Modulus, this is easy:  just follow their instructions.\n\n\nOtherwise get the IP address of your server and \nssh\n onto it.  Then \nnpm install -g sails\n and \nnpm install -g forever\n to install Sails and \nforever\n globally from NPM for the first time on the server.

In other words, fast!  We've done some optimizations ourselves in Sails core, but primarily our focus is not messing up what we get for free from our dependencies.  For a quick and dirty benchmark, see \nhttp://serdardogruyol.com/sails-vs-rails-a-quick-and-dirty-benchmark\n.\n\n\nThe most common performance bottleneck in production Sails applications is the database.  Over the lifetime of an application with a growing user base, it becomes increasingly important to set up good indexes on your tables/collections, and to use queries which return paginated results.  Eventually as your production database grows to contain tens of millions of records, you will start to locate and optimize slow queries by hand (either by calling \n.query()\n or \n.native()\n, or by using the underlying database driver from NPM).  \n\n\nWhat's this warning about the connect session memory store?\n#\n\n\nIf you are using sessions in your Sails app, you should not use the built-in memory store in production.

If you have your own benchmark you'd like to share, please write a blog post or article and tweet \n@sailsjs\n.  But benchmarks aside, keep in mind that most performance and scalability metrics are application-specific.  The actual performance of your app will have a lot more to do with the way you implement your business logic and model calls than it will about the underlying framework you are using.\n\n\nExample architecture\n#\n\n\n                             ....                 \n                    /  Sails.js server  \\      /  Database (e.g. Mongo, Postgres, etc)\nLoad Balancer  <-->    Sails.js server    <-->    Socket.io message queue (Redis)\n                    \\  Sails.js server  /      \\  Session store (Redis, Mongo, etc.)\n                             ....                 \n\n\n\n\nPreparing your app for a clustered deployment\n#\n\n\nThe most important thing to remember about scaling a server-side application is that it should be \nstateless\n.  That means you should be able to deploy the same code to \nn\n different servers, expecting any given incoming request handled by any given server, and everything should still work.  Luckily, Sails apps come ready for this kind of deployment almost right out of the box.  But before deploying your app to multiple servers, there are a few things you need to do:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure none of the other dependencies you might be using in your app rely on shared memory.\n\n\nMake sure the database(s) for your models (e.g. MySQL, Postgres, Mongo) are scalable (e.g. sharding/cluster)\n\n\nIf your app uses sessions:\n\n\nConfigure your app to use a shared session store such as Redis (simply uncomment the \nadapter\n option in \nconfig/session.js\n) and install the connect-redis adapter as a dependency of your app (e.g. \nnpm install connect-redis@~3.0.2 --save --save-exact\n).\n\n\nIf your app uses sockets:\n\n\nConfigure your app to use Redis as a shared message queue for delivering socket.io messages (uncomment the \nadapter\n option in \nconfig/sockets.js\n)\n\n\nInstall the socket.io-redis adapter as a dependency of your app (e.g. \nnpm install socket.io-redis@~1.0.0 --save --save-exact\n)\n\n\nIf your cluster is on a single server (for instance, using \npm2 cluster mode\n)\n\n\nTo avoid file conflict issues due to Grunt tasks, always start your apps in \nproduction\n environment, and/or consider \nturning Grunt off completely\n.  See \nhere\n for more details on Grunt issues in single-server clusters\n\n\nBe careful with \nconfig/bootstrap.js\n code\n that persists data in a database, to avoid conflicts when the bootstrap runs multiple times (once per node in the cluster)\n\n\n\n\nDeploying a Node/Sails app to a PaaS\n#\n\n\nDeploying your app to a PaaS like Heroku or Modulus is dead simple. Depending on your situation, there may still be a few devils in the details, but Node support with hosting providers has gotten \nreally good\n over the last couple of years.  Take a look at \nHosting\n for more platform-specific information.\n\n\nDeploying your own cluster\n#\n\n\n\n\nDeploy multiple instances (aka servers running a copy of your app) behind a \nload balancer\n (e.g. nginx)\n\n\nConfigure your load balancer to terminate SSL requests\n\n\nBut remember that you won't need to use the SSL configuration in Sails-- the traffic will already be decrypted by the time it reaches Sails.\n\n\nLift your app on each instance using a daemon like \nforever\n or \npm2\n (see http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/deployment for more about daemonology)\n\n\n\n\nOptimization\n#\n\n\nOptimizing an endpoint in your Node/Sails app is exactly like optimizing an endpoint in any other server-side application; e.g. identifying and manually optimizing slow queries, reducing the number of queries, etc.  Specifically for Node apps, if you find you have a heavily trafficked endpoint that is eating up CPU, look for synchronous (blocking) model methods, services, or machines that might be getting called over and over again in a loop or recursive dive.\n\n\nBut remember:\n\n\n\n\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil.  -\nDonald Knuth\n\n\n\n\nNo matter what tool you're using, it is important to spend your focus and time on writing high quality, well documented, readable code.  That way, if/when you are forced to optimize a code path in your application, you'll find it is much easier to do so.\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don't have to use Redis for your sessions-- you can actually use any Connect or Express-compatible session store.  See \nsails.config.session\n for more information.\n\n\nThe default Socket.io configuration initially attempts to connect to the server using \nlong-polling\n.  In order for this to work, your server environment \nmust support\n sticky load-balancing (aka sticky sessions), otherwise the handshake will fail until the connection is upgraded to use Websockets (and only if Websockets are available).\n\n\nOn \nHeroku\n, you must have the sticky load-balancing beta feature \nexplicitly enabled\n.\n\n\nIn an environment without stickky load balancing, you will need to set the \ntransports\n setting in \nconfig/sockets.js\n to \n['websocket']\n, forcing it to use websockets only and avoid long-polling.  You'll also need to set the transports in your socket client--if you're using \nsails.io.js\n, this is as easy as adding a \n<script>io.sails.transports=['websocket']</script>\n immediately after the \nsails.io.js\n script include.

That means you should be able to deploy the same code to  n  different servers, expecting any given incoming request handled by any given server, and everything should still work.  Luckily, Sails apps come ready for this kind of deployment almost right out of the box.  But before deploying your app to multiple servers, there are a few things you need to do:   Ensure none of the other dependencies you might be using in your app rely on shared memory.  Make sure the database(s) for your models (e.g. MySQL, Postgres, Mongo) are scalable (e.g. sharding/cluster)  If your app uses sessions:  Configure your app to use a shared session store such as Redis (simply uncomment the  adapter  option in  config/session.js ) and install the connect-redis adapter as a dependency of your app (e.g.  npm install connect-redis@~3.0.2 --save --save-exact ).  If your app uses sockets:  Configure your app to use Redis as a shared message queue for delivering socket.io messages (uncomment the  adapter  option in  config/sockets.js )  Install the socket.io-redis adapter as a dependency of your app (e.g.  npm install socket.io-redis@~1.0.0 --save --save-exact )  If your cluster is on a single server (for instance, using  pm2 cluster mode )  To avoid file conflict issues due to Grunt tasks, always start your apps in  production  environment, and/or consider  turning Grunt off completely .  See  here  for more details on Grunt issues in single-server clusters  Be careful with  config/bootstrap.js  code  that persists data in a database, to avoid conflicts when the bootstrap runs multiple times (once per node in the cluster)",

On  Heroku , you must have the sticky load-balancing beta feature  explicitly enabled .  In an environment without stickky load balancing, you will need to set the  transports  setting in  config/sockets.js  to  ['websocket'] , forcing it to use websockets only and avoid long-polling.  You'll also need to set the transports in your socket client--if you're using  sails.io.js , this is as easy as adding a  <script>io.sails.transports=['websocket']</script>  immediately after the  sails.io.js  script include.

It is, however, probably different than what you're used to if you're coming from a different server-side platform like PHP, .NET, Python, Ruby, or Java.  But fear not: the core team has gone to great lengths to make file uploads easier to accomplish, while still keeping them scalable and secure.\n\n\nSails comes with a powerful \"body parser\" called \nSkipper\n which makes it easy to implement streaming file uploads-- not only to the server's filesystem (i.e. hard disk), but also to Amazon S3, MongoDB's gridfs, or any of its other supported file adapters.\n\n\nUploading a file\n#\n\n\nFiles are uploaded to HTTP web servers as \nfile parameters\n.  In the same way you might send a form POST to a URL with text parameters like \"name\", \"email\", and \"password\", you send files as file parameters, like \"avatar\" or \"newSong\".\n\n\nTake this simple example:\n\n\nreq.file('avatar').upload(function (err, uploadedFiles) {\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nFiles should be uploaded inside of an \naction\n in one of your controllers.  Here's a more in-depth example that demonstrates how you could allow users to upload an avatar image and associate it with their accounts.  It assumes you've already taken care of access control in a policy, and that you're storing the id of the logged-in user in \nreq.session.me\n.\n\n\n// api/controllers/UserController.js\n//\n// ...\n\n\n/**\n * Upload avatar for currently logged-in user\n *\n * (POST /user/avatar)\n */\nuploadAvatar: function (req, res) {\n\n  req.file('avatar').upload({\n    // don't allow the total upload size to exceed ~10MB\n    maxBytes: 10000000\n  },function whenDone(err, uploadedFiles) {\n    if (err) {\n      return res.negotiate(err);\n    }\n\n    // If no files were uploaded, respond with an error.\n    if (uploadedFiles.length === 0){\n      return res.badRequest('No file was uploaded');\n    }\n\n\n    // Save the \"fd\" and the url where the avatar for a user can be accessed\n    User.update(req.session.me, {\n\n      // Generate a unique URL where the avatar can be downloaded.\n      avatarUrl: require('util').format('%s/user/avatar/%s', sails.getBaseUrl(), req.session.me),\n\n      // Grab the first file and use it's `fd` (file descriptor)\n      avatarFd: uploadedFiles[0].fd\n    })\n    .exec(function (err){\n      if (err) return res.negotiate(err);\n      return res.ok();\n    });\n  });\n},\n\n\n/**\n * Download avatar of the user with the specified id\n *\n * (GET /user/avatar/:id)\n */\navatar: function (req, res){\n\n  req.validate({\n    id: 'string'\n  });\n\n  User.findOne(req.param('id')).exec(function (err, user){\n    if (err) return res.negotiate(err);\n    if (!user) return res.notFound();\n\n    // User has no avatar image uploaded.\n    // (should have never have hit this endpoint and used the default image)\n    if (!user.avatarFd) {\n      return res.notFound();\n    }\n\n    var SkipperDisk = require('skipper-disk');\n    var fileAdapter = SkipperDisk(/* optional opts */);\n\n    // set the filename to the same file as the user uploaded\n    res.set(\"Content-disposition\", \"attachment; filename='\" + file.name + \"'\");\n\n    // Stream the file down\n    fileAdapter.read(user.avatarFd)\n    .on('error', function (err){\n      return res.serverError(err);\n    })\n    .pipe(res);\n  });\n}\n\n//\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nWhere do the files go?\n#\n\n\nWhen using the default \nreceiver\n, file uploads go to the \nmyApp/.tmp/uploads/\n directory.  You can override this using the \ndirname\n option.  Note that you'll need to provide this option both when you call the \n.upload()\n function AND when you invoke the skipper-disk adapter (so that you are uploading to and downloading from the same place.)\n\n\nUploading to a custom folder\n#\n\n\nIn the above example we upload the file to .tmp/uploads. So how do we configure it with a custom folder, say \u2018assets/images\u2019.

Much of the code you'll write in Sails is effectively middleware; most notably \ncontroller actions\n and \npolicies\n.\n\n\nHTTP Middleware\n#\n\n\nSails also utilizes an additional \nconfigurable middleware stack\n just for handling HTTP requests.  Each time your app receives an HTTP request, the configured HTTP middleware stack runs in order.\n\n\nRead about the default middleware stack \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this HTTP middleware stack is only used for \"true\" HTTP requests-- it is ignored for \nvirtual requests\n (e.g. requests from a live Socket.io connection.)\n\n\n\n\nAdding or Overriding HTTP Middleware\n#\n\n\nTo configure a custom HTTP middleware function, define a new HTTP key \nsails.config.http.middleware.foobar\n and set it to the configured middleware function, then add the string name (\"foobar\") to your \nsails.config.http.middleware.order\n array wherever you'd like it to run in the middleware chain (a good place to put it might be right before \"cookieParser\"):\n\n\nE.g. in \nconfig/http.js\n:\n\n\n  // ...\n  middleware: {\n\n    // Define a custom HTTP middleware fn with the key `foobar`:\n    foobar: function (req,res,next) { /*...*/ next(); },\n\n    // Define another couple of custom HTTP middleware fns with keys `passportInit` and `passportSession`\n    // (notice that this time we're using an existing middleware library from npm)\n    passportInit    : require('passport').initialize(),\n    passportSession : require('passport').session(),\n\n    // Override the conventional cookie parser:\n    cookieParser: function (req, res, next) { /*...*/ next(); },\n\n\n    // Now configure the order/arrangement of our HTTP middleware\n    order: [\n      'startRequestTimer',\n      'cookieParser',\n      'session',\n      'passportInit',            // <==== passport HTTP middleware should run after \"session\"\n      'passportSession',         // <==== (see https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport#middleware)\n      'bodyParser',\n      'compress',\n      'foobar',                  // <==== we can put this stuff wherever we want\n      'methodOverride',\n      'poweredBy',\n      '$custom',\n      'router',\n      'www',\n      'favicon',\n      '404',\n      '500'\n    ]\n  },\n\n  customMiddleware: function(app){\n     //Intended for other middleware that doesn't follow 'app.use(middleware)' convention\n     require('other-middleware').initialize(app);\n  }\n  // ...\n\n\n\n\nExpress Middleware In Sails\n#\n\n\nOne of the really nice things about Sails apps is that they can take advantage of the wealth of already-existing Express/Connect middleware out there.  But a common question that arises when people \nactually\n try to do this is:\n\n\n\n\n\"Where do I \napp.use()\n this thing?\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the answer is to install the Express middleware as a custom HTTP middleware in \nsails.config.http.middleware\n.  This will trigger it for ALL HTTP requests to your Sails app, and allow you to configure the order in which it runs in relation to other HTTP middleware.\n\n\n\n\nYou should never override or remove the \nrouter\n HTTP middleware.  It is built-in to Sails, and without it, your app's explicit routes and blueprint routes will not work.\n\n\n\n\nExpress Routing Middleware In Sails\n#\n\n\nYou can also include Express middleware as a policy- just configure it in \nconfig/policies.js\n.  You can either require and setup the middleware in an actual wrapper policy (usually a good idea) or just require it directly in your policies.js file.  The following example uses the latter strategy for brevity:\n\n\nvar auth = require('http-auth');\nvar basic = auth.basic({\n  realm: 'admin area'\n}, function (username, password, onwards) {\n  return onwards(username === 'Tina' && password === 'Bullock');\n});\n\n//...\nmodule.exports.policies = {\n  '*': true,\n\n  ProductController: {\n\n    // Prevent end users from doing CRUD operations on products reserved for admins\n    // (uses HTTP basic auth)\n    '*': auth.connect(basic),\n\n    // Everyone can view product pages\n    show: true\n  }\n}",

In most cases, the answer is to install the Express middleware as a custom HTTP middleware in  sails.config.http.middleware .  This will trigger it for ALL HTTP requests to your Sails app, and allow you to configure the order in which it runs in relation to other HTTP middleware.   You should never override or remove the  router  HTTP middleware.  It is built-in to Sails, and without it, your app's explicit routes and blueprint routes will not work.",

A model called \nPerson\n might have attributes called \nfirstName\n, \nlastName\n, \nphoneNumber\n, \nage\n, \nbirthDate\n and \nemailAddress\n.\n\n\n\nAttribute Options\n#\n\n\nThese options can be used to enforce various constraints and add special enhancements to our model attributes.\n\n\ntype\n#\n\n\nSpecifies the type of data that will be stored in this attribute.  One of:\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\ntext\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nfloat\n\n\ndate\n\n\ndatetime\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nbinary\n\n\narray\n\n\njson\n\n\nmediumtext\n\n\nlongtext\n\n\nobjectid\n\n\n\n\ndefaultsTo\n#\n\n\nWhen a record is created, if no value was supplied, the record will be created with the specified \ndefaultsTo\n value. The supplied value can also be a function that waterline will run while creating the record.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  phoneNumber: {\n    type: 'string',\n    defaultsTo: '111-222-3333'\n  },\n  orderNumber: {\n    type: 'text',\n    defaultsTo: function() {\n      return uuid.v4();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nautoIncrement\n#\n\n\nSets up the attribute as an auto-increment key.  When a new record is added to the model, if a value for this attribute is not specified, it will be generated by incrementing the most recent record's value by one. Note: Attributes which specify \nautoIncrement\n should always be of \ntype: 'integer'\n. Also, bear in mind that the level of support varies across different datastores. For instance, MySQL will not allow more than one auto-incrementing column per table.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  placeInLine: {\n    type: 'integer',\n    autoIncrement: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nunique\n#\n\n\nEnsures no two records will be allowed with the same value for the target attribute. This is an adapter-level constraint, so in most cases this will result in a unique index on the attribute being created in the underlying datastore.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  username: {\n    type: 'string',\n    unique: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using MySQL with the \nutf8mb4\n character set, you will need to add the \nsize\n constraint to the appropriate column in your table directly via MySQL. Otherwise, since \ntype: 'string'\n is translated to \nvarchar(255)\n in the MySQL adapter, the \nunique: true\n constraint will cause an 'index too long' error: \nER_INDEX_COLUMN_TOO_LONG: Index column size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprimaryKey\n#\n\n\nUse this attribute as the the primary key for the record. Only one attribute per model can be the \nprimaryKey\n.  Note: This should never be used unless \nautoPK\n is set to false.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  uuid: {\n    type: 'string',\n    primaryKey: true,\n    required: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nenum\n#\n\n\nA special validation property which only saves data which matches a whitelisted set of values.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  state: {\n    type: 'string',\n    enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'denied']\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize\n#\n\n\nIf supported in the adapter, can be used to define the size of the attribute. For example in MySQL, \nsize\n can be specified as a number (\nn\n) to create a column with the SQL data type: \nvarchar(n)\n.\n\n\nattributes: {\n  name: {\n    type: 'string',\n    size: 24\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\ncolumnName\n#\n\n\nInside an attribute definition, you can specify a \ncolumnName\n to force Sails/Waterline to store data for that attribute in a specific column in the configured connection (i.e. database).  Be aware that this is not necessarily SQL-specific-- it will also work for MongoDB fields, etc.\n\n\nWhile the \ncolumnName\n property is primarily designed for working with existing/legacy databases, it can also be useful in situations where your database is being shared by other applications, or you don't have access permissions to change the schema.\n\n\nTo store/fetch your model's \nnumberOfWheels\n attribute into/from the \nnumber_of_round_rotating_things\n column:\n\n\n  // An attribute in one of your models:\n  // ...\n  numberOfWheels: {\n    type: 'integer',\n    columnName: 'number_of_round_rotating_things'\n  }\n  // ...\n\n\n\n\nNow for a more thorough/realistic example.\n\n\nLet's say you have a \nUser\n model in your Sails app that looks like this:\n\n\n// api/models/User.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  connection: 'shinyNewMySQLDatabase',\n  attributes: {\n    name: {\n      type: 'string'\n    },\n    password: {\n      type: 'string'\n    },\n    email: {\n      type: 'email',\n      unique: true\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nEverything works great, but instead of using an existing MySQL database sitting on a server somewhere that happens to house your app's intended users:\n\n\n// config/connections.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n\n  // Existing users are in here!\n  rustyOldMySQLDatabase: {\n    adapter: 'sails-mysql',\n    user: 'bofh',\n    host: 'db.eleven.sameness.foo',\n    password: 'Gh19R!?had9gzQ#Q#Q#%AdsghaDABAMR>##G<ADMBOVRH@)$(HTOADG!GNADSGADSGNBI@(',\n    database: 'jonas'\n  },\n  // ...\n};\n\n\n\n\nLet's say there's a table called \nour_users\n in the old MySQL database that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe_primary_key\n\n\nemail_address\n\n\nfull_name\n\n\nseriously_encrypted_password\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nmike@sameness.foo\n\n\nMike McNeil\n\n\nranchdressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nnick@sameness.foo\n\n\nNick Crumrine\n\n\nthousandisland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use this from Sails, you'd change your \nUser\n model to look like this:\n\n\n// api/models/User.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  connection: 'rustyOldMySQLDatabase',\n  tableName: 'our_users',\n  attributes: {\n    id: {\n      type: 'integer',\n      unique: true,\n      primaryKey: true,\n      columnName: 'the_primary_key'\n    },\n    name: {\n      type: 'string',\n      columnName: 'full_name'\n    },\n    password: {\n      type: 'string',\n      columnName: 'seriously_encrypted_password'\n    },\n    email: {\n      type: 'email',\n      unique: true,\n      columnName: 'email_address'\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have noticed that we also used the \ntableName\n property in this example.

Models are usually defined by creating a file in an app's \napi/models/\n folder.\n\n\n// Parrot.js\n// The set of parrots registered in our app.\nmodule.exports = {\n  attributes: {\n    // e.g., \"Polly\"\n    name: {\n      type: 'string'\n    },\n\n    // e.g., 3.26\n    wingspan: {\n      type: 'float',\n      required: true\n    },\n\n    // e.g., \"cm\"\n    wingspanUnits: {\n      type: 'string',\n      enum: ['cm', 'in', 'm', 'mm'],\n      defaultsTo: 'cm'\n    },\n\n    // e.g., [{...}, {...}, ...]\n    knownDialects: {\n      collection: 'Dialect'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing models\n#\n\n\nModels may be accessed from our controllers, policies, services, responses, tests, and in custom model methods.  There are many built-in methods available on models, the most important of which are the query methods: \nfind\n, \ncreate\n, \nupdate\n, and \ndestroy\n.  These methods are \nasynchronous\n - under the covers, Waterline has to send a query to the database and wait for a response.\n\n\nConsequently, query methods return a deferred query object.  To actually execute a query, \n.exec(cb)\n must be called on this deferred object, where \ncb\n is a callback function to run after the query is complete.\n\n\nWaterline also includes opt-in support for promises.  Instead of calling \n.exec()\n on a query object, we can call \n.then()\n, \n.spread()\n, or \n.catch()\n, which will return a \nBluebird promise\n.\n\n\nModel Methods (aka \"static\" or \"class\" methods)\n#\n\n\nModel class methods are functions built into the model itself that perform a particular task on its instances (records).  This is where you will find the familiar CRUD methods for performing database operations like \n.create()\n, \n.update()\n, \n.destroy()\n, \n.find()\n, etc.\n\n\nCustom model methods\n#\n\n\nWaterline allows you to define custom methods on your models.  This feature takes advantage of the fact that Waterline models ignore unrecognized keys, so you do need to be careful about inadvertently overriding built-in methods and dynamic finders (don't define methods named \"create\", etc.)  Custom model methods are most useful for extrapolating controller code that relates to a particular model; i.e. this allows you to pull code out of your controllers and into reusuable functions that can be called from anywhere (i.e. don't depend on \nreq\n or \nres\n.)\n\n\nModel methods are generally asynchronous functions.  By convention, asynchronous model methods should be 2-ary functions, which accept an object of inputs as their first argument (usually called \nopts\n or \noptions\n) and a Node callback as the second argument.  Alternatively, you might opt to return a promise (both strategies work just fine- it's a matter of preference.  If you don't have a preference, stick with Node callbacks.)\n\n\nA best practice is to write your static model method so that it can accept either a record OR its primary key value.  For model methods that operate on/from \nmultiple\n records at once, you should allow an array of records OR an array of primary key values to be passed in.  This takes more time to write, but makes your method much more powerful.  And since you're doing this to extrapolate commonly-used logic anyway, it's usually worth the extra effort.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n// in api/models/Monkey.js...\n\n// Find monkeys with the same name as the specified person\nfindWithSameNameAsPerson: function (opts, cb) {\n\n  var person = opts.person;\n\n  // Before doing anything else, check if a primary key value\n  // was passed in instead of a record, and if so, lookup which\n  // person we're even talking about:\n  (function _lookupPersonIfNecessary(afterLookup){\n    // (this self-calling function is just for concise-ness)\n    if (typeof person === 'object')) return afterLookup(null, person);\n    Person.findOne(person).exec(afterLookup);\n  })(function (err, person){\n    if (err) return cb(err);\n    if (!person) {\n      err = new Error();\n      err.message = require('util').format('Cannot find monkeys with the same name as the person w/ id=%s because that person does not exist.', person);\n      err.status = 404;\n      return cb(err);\n    }\n\n    Monkey.findByName(person.name)\n    .exec(function (err, monkeys){\n      if (err) return cb(err);\n      cb(null, monkeys);\n    })\n  });\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen you can do:\n\n\nMonkey.findWithSameNameAsPerson(albus, function (err, monkeys) { ... });\n// -or-\nMonkey.findWithSameNameAsPerson(37, function (err, monkeys) { ... });\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more tips, read about the incident involving \nTimothy the Monkey\n.\n\n\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n// api/models/User.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  attributes: {\n\n    name: {\n      type: 'string'\n    },\n    enrolledIn: {\n      collection: 'Course', via: 'students'\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Enrolls a user in one or more courses.\n   * @param  {Object}   options\n   *            => courses {Array} list of course ids\n   *            => id {Integer} id of the enrolling user\n   * @param  {Function} cb\n   */\n  enroll: function (options, cb) {\n\n    User.findOne(options.id).exec(function (err, theUser) {\n      if (err) return cb(err);\n      if (!theUser) return cb(new Error('User not found.'));\n      theUser.enrolledIn.add(options.courses);\n      theUser.save(cb);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Finders\n#\n\n\nThese are special static methods that are dynamically generated by Sails when you lift your app.  For instance, if your Person model has a \"firstName\", you might run:\n\n\nPerson.findByFirstName('emma').exec(function(err,people){ ... });\n\n\n\n\nResourceful Pubsub Methods\n#\n\n\nA special type of model methods which are attached by the pubsub hook.  More on that in the \nsection of the docs on resourceful pubsub\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute Methods (i.e. record/instance methods)\n#\n\n\nAttribute methods are functions available on records (i.e. model instances) returned from Waterline queries.  For example, if you find the ten students with the highest GPA from the Student model, each of those student records will have access to all the built-in attribute methods, as well as any custom attribute methods defined on the Student model.\n\n\nBuilt-in attribute methods\n#\n\n\nEvery Waterline model includes some attribute methods automatically, including:\n\n\n\n\n.toJSON()\n\n\n.save()\n\n\n.destroy()\n\n\n.validate()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom attribute methods\n#\n\n\nWaterline models also allow you to define your own custom attribute methods.  Define them like any other attribute, but instead of an attribute definition object, write a function on the right-hand-side.\n\n\n// From api/models/Person.js...\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  attributes: {\n    // Primitive attributes\n    firstName: {\n      type: 'string',\n      defaultsTo: ''\n    },\n    lastName: {\n      type: 'string',\n      defaultsTo: ''\n    },\n\n    // Associations (aka relational attributes)\n    spouse: { model: 'Person' },\n    pets: { collection: 'Pet' },\n\n    // Attribute methods\n    getFullName: function (){\n      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\n    },\n    isMarried: function () {\n      return !!this.spouse;\n    },\n    isEligibleForSocialSecurity: function (){\n      return this.age >= 65;\n    },\n    encryptPassword: function () {\n\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that with the notable exception of the built-in \n.save()\n and \n.destroy()\n attribute methods, attribute methods are almost always \nsynchronous\n by convention.\n\n\nAlso note that custom attributes methods are not serialized to JSON by default.  To serialize them, you can override \ntoJSON\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to write a custom attribute method\n#\n\n\nCustom attribute methods are particularly useful for extracting some information out of a record.  I.e. you might want to reduce some information from one or more attributes (i.e. \"is this person married?\"\")\n\n\nif ( rick.isMarried() ) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen NOT to write a custom attribute method\n#\n\n\nYou should \navoid writing your own \nasynchronous\n attribute methods\n.  While built-in asynchronous attribute methods like \n.save()\n and \n.destroy()\n can be convenient from your app code, writing your \nown\n asynchronous attribute methods can sometimes have unintended consequences, and is not the most efficient way to build your app.\n\n\nFor instance, consider an app that manages wedding records.  You might think to write an attribute method on the Person model that updates the \nspouse\n attribute on both individuals in the database.  This would allow you to write controller code like:\n\n\npersonA.marry(personB, function (err) {\n  if (err) return res.negotiate(err);\n  return res.ok();\n})\n\n\n\n\nWhich looks great...until you need to write a different action where you don't have an actual record for \"personA\".\n\n\nA better strategy is to write a custom (static) model method instead.  This makes your function more reusable/versatile, since it will be accessible whether or not you have an actual record instance on hand.  You might refactor the code from the previous example to look like:\n\n\nPerson.marry([joe,raquel], function (err) {\n  if (err) return res.negotiate(err);\n  return res.ok();\n})\n\n\n\n\nNaming your attribute methods\n#\n\n\nMake sure you use a naming convention that helps you avoid confusing \nattribute methods\n from \nattribute values\n when you're working with records in your app.  A good best practice is to use \"get*\" (e.g. \ngetFullName()\n) prefix and avoid writing attribute methods that change records in-place.",

            "text": "Waterline: SQL/noSQL Data Mapper (ORM/ODM)\n#\n\n\nSails comes installed with a powerful \nORM/ODM\n called \nWaterline\n, a datastore-agnostic tool that dramatically simplifies interaction with one or more \ndatabases\n.  It provides an abstraction layer on top of the underlying database, allowing you to easily query and manipulate your data \nwithout\n writing vendor-specific integration code.\n\n\nDatabase Agnosticism\n#\n\n\nIn schemaful databases like \nPostgres\n, \nOracle\n, and \nMySQL\n, models are represented by tables.  In \nMongoDB\n, they're represented by Mongo \"collections\".  In \nRedis\n, they're represented using key/value pairs.  Each database has its own distinct query dialect, and in some cases even requires installing and compiling a specific native module to connect to the server.  This involves a fair amount of overhead, and garners an unsettling level of \nvendor lock-in\n to a specific database; e.g. if your app uses a bunch of SQL queries, it will be very hard to switch to Mongo later, or Redis, and vice versa.\n\n\nWaterline query syntax floats above all that, focusing on business logic like creating new records, fetching/searching existing records, updating records, or destroying records.  No matter what database you're contacting, the usage is \nexactly the same\n.  Furthermore, Waterline allows you to \n.populate()\n associations between models, \neven if\n the data for each model lives in a different database.  That means you can switch your app's models from Mongo, to Postgres, to MySQL, to Redis, and back again - without changing any code.  For the times when you need low-level, database-specific functionality, Waterline provides a query interface that allows you to talk directly to your models' underlying database driver (see \n.query()\n and \n.native()\n.)\n\n\nScenario\n#\n\n\nLet's imagine you're building an e-commerce website, with an accompanying mobile app.  Users browse products by category or search for products by keyword, then they buy them.  That's it!  Some parts of your app are quite ordinary; you have an API-driven flow for logging in, signing up, order/payment processing, resetting passwords, etc. However, you know there are a few mundane features lurking in your roadmap that will likely become more involved.  Sure enough:\n\n\nFlexibility\n#\n\n\nYou ask the business what database they would like to use:\n\n\n\n\n\"Datab... what?  Let's not be hasty, wouldn't want to make the wrong choice.  I'll get ops/IT on it.  Go ahead and get started though.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional methodology of choosing one single database for a web application/API is actually prohibitive for many production use cases.  Oftentimes the application needs to maintain compatibility with one or more existing data sets, or it is necessary to use a few different types of databases for performance reasons.\n\n\nSince Sails uses \nsails-disk\n by default, you can start building your app with zero configuration, using a local temporary file as storage.  When you're ready to switch to the real thing (and when everyone knows what that even is), just change your app's \nconnection configuration\n.\n\n\nCompatibility\n#\n\n\nThe product owner/stakeholder walks up to you and says:\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh hey by the way, the products actually already live in our point of sale system. It's some ERP thing I guess, something like \"DB2\"?  Anyways, I'm sure you'll figure it out- sounds easy right?\"\n\n\n\n\nMany enterprise applications must integrate with an existing database.  If you're lucky, a one-time data migration may be all that's necessary, but more commonly, the existing dataset is still being modified by other applications.  In order to build your app, you might need to marry data from multiple legacy systems, or with a separate dataset stored elsewhere.  These datasets could live on 5 different servers scattered across the world! One colocated database server might house a SQL database with relational data, while another cloud server might hold a handful of Mongo or Redis collections.\n\n\nSails/Waterline lets you hook up different models to different datastores; locally or anywhere on the internet.  You can build a User model that maps to a custom MySQL table in a legacy database (with weird crazy column names).  Same thing for a Product model that maps to a table in DB2, or an Order model that maps to a MongoDB collection.

Normally when you hear bloggers and analyst use that buzzword, you think of data mining and business intelligence.  You might imagine a process that pulls data from multiple sources, processes/indexes/analyzes it, then writes that extracted information somewhere else and either keeps the original data or throws it away.\n\n\nHowever, there are some much more common challenges that lend themselves to the same sort of indexing/analysis needs; features like \"driving-direction-closeness\" search, or a recommendation engine for related products.

Certain databases are very good at answering traditional relational business queries, while others are better suited for map/reduce-style processing of data, with optimizations/trade-offs for blazing-fast read/writes.  This consideration is especially important as your app's user-base scales.\n\n\nAdapters\n#\n\n\nLike most MVC frameworks, Sails supports \nmultiple databases\n.  That means the syntax to query and manipulate our data is always the same, whether we're using MongoDB, MySQL, or any other supported database.\n\n\nWaterline builds on this flexibility with its concept of adapters.  An adapter is a bit of code that maps methods like \nfind()\n and \ncreate()\n to a lower-level syntax like \nSELECT * FROM\n and \nINSERT INTO\n.  The Sails core team maintains open-source adapters for a handful of the \nmost popular databases\n, and a wealth of \ncommunity adapters\n are also available.\n\n\nCustom Waterline adapters are actually \npretty simple to build\n, and can make for more maintainable integrations; anything from a proprietary enterprise account system, to a cache, to a traditional database.\n\n\nConnections\n#\n\n\nA \nconnection\n represents a particular database configuration.  This configuration object includes an adapter to use, as well as information like the host, port, username, password, and so forth.  If your database doesn't require a password simply delete the password property. Connections are defined in \nconfig/connections.js\n.\n\n\n// in config/connections.js\n// ...\n{\n  adapter: 'sails-mysql',\n  host: 'localhost',\n  port: 3306,\n  user: 'root',\n  password: 'g3tInCr4zee&stUfF'\n}\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the adapter in use, it's also possible to use unix sockets, without port and host or a URL. Here's an example using an existing MAMP mysql server and sails-mysql adapter:\n\n\n// in config/local.js\n// ...\nconnections:{\n  local_mysql:{ //arbitrary name\n    module: 'sails-mysql',\n    user: 'root',\n    password: 'root',\n    database: 'sailstest1',\n    socketPath: '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock'\n  }\n}\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nAnd another showing an example of configuring the adapter using a url:\n\n\n// in config/local.js\n// ...\nconnections:{\n  local_mysql:{ //arbitrary name\n    module: 'sails-mysql',\n    url: 'mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/sailstest1'\n  }\n}\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nThe default database connection for a Sails app is located in the base model configuration (\nconfig/models.js\n), but it can also be overriden on a per-model basis by specifying a \nconnection\n.\nOften it is also useful override the connections object in \nconfig/local.js\n\n\nAnalogy\n#\n\n\nImagine a file cabinet full of completed pen-and-ink forms. All of the forms have the same fields (e.g. \"name\", \"birthdate\", \"maritalStatus\"), but for each form, the \nvalues\n written in the fields vary.  For example, one form might contain \"Lara\", \"2000-03-16T21:16:15.127Z\", \"single\", while another form contains \"Larry\", \"1974-01-16T21:16:15.127Z\", \"married\".\n\n\nNow imagine you're running a hotdog business.  If you were \nvery\n organized, you might set up your file cabinets as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee\n (contains your employee records)\n\n\nfullName\n\n\nhourlyWage\n\n\nphoneNumber\n\n\nLocation\n (contains a record for each location you operate)\n\n\nstreetAddress\n\n\ncity\n\n\nstate\n\n\nzipcode\n\n\npurchases\n\n\na list of all the purchases made at this location\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanager\n\n\nthe employee who manages this location\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase\n (contains a record for each purchase made by one of your customers)\n\n\nmadeAtLocation\n\n\nproductsPurchased\n\n\ncreatedAt\n\n\nProduct\n (contains a record for each of your various product offerings)\n\n\nnameOnMenu\n\n\nprice\n\n\nnumCalories\n\n\npercentRealMeat\n\n\navailableAt\n\n\na list of the locations where this product offering is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your Sails app, a \nmodel\n is like one of the file cabinets.  It contains \nrecords\n, which are like the forms.  \nAttributes\n are like the fields in each form.\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis documentation on models is not applicable if you are overriding the built-in ORM, \nWaterline\n.  In that case, your models will follow whatever convention you set up, on top of whatever ORM library you're using (e.g. Mongoose.)",

Under the covers, Waterline uses the database adapter(s) installed in your project to translates this language into native queries, and then to send those queries to the appropriate database.  This means that you can use the same query with MySQL as you do with Redis, or MongoDb. And it allows you to change your database with minimal (if any) changes to your application code.\n\n\n\n\nAll queries inside of Waterline are case-insensitive. While this allows for more consistent querying across databases, depending on the database you're using, it can make indexing strings tough.  This is something to be aware of if you plan to create indexes in your database to optimize the performance of searching on string fields.\n\n\n\n\nQuery Language Basics\n#\n\n\nThe criteria objects are formed using one of four types of object keys. These are the top level\nkeys used in a query object. It is loosely based on the criteria used in MongoDB with a few slight variations.\n\n\nQueries can be built using either a \nwhere\n key to specify attributes, which will allow you to also use query options such as \nlimit\n and \nskip\n or, if \nwhere\n is excluded, the entire object will be treated as a \nwhere\n criteria.\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name: 'mary'\n}).exec(function (err, peopleNamedMary){\n\n});\n\n\n// OR\n\n\nModel.find({\n  where: { name: 'mary' },\n  skip: 20,\n  limit: 10,\n  sort: 'createdAt DESC'\n}).exec(function(err, thirdPageOfRecentPeopleNamedMary){\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nKey Pairs\n#\n\n\nA key pair can be used to search records for values matching exactly what is specified. This is the base of a criteria object where the key represents an attribute on a model and the value is a strict equality check of the records for matching values.\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name: 'lyra'\n}).exec(function (err, peopleNamedLyra) {\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nThey can be used together to search multiple attributes.\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name: 'walter',\n  state: 'new mexico'\n}).exec(function (err, waltersFromNewMexico) {\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nModified Pairs\n#\n\n\nModified pairs also have model attributes for keys but they also use any of the supported criteria modifiers to perform queries where a strict equality check wouldn't work.\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name : {\n    'contains' : 'yra'\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nIn Pairs\n#\n\n\nProvide an array to find records whose value for this attribute exactly matches (case-insensitive) \nany\n of the specified search terms.\n\n\n\n\nThis is more or less equivalent to \"IN\" queries in SQL, and the \n$in\n operator in MongoDB.\n\n\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name : ['walter', 'skyler']\n}).exec(function (err, waltersAndSkylers){\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nNot-In Pairs\n#\n\n\nProvide an array wrapped in a dictionary under a \n!\n key (like \n{ '!': [...] }\n) to find records whose value for this attribute \nARE NOT\n exact matches (case-insensitive) for any of the specified search terms.\n\n\n\n\nThis is more or less equivalent to \"NOT IN\" queries in SQL, and the \n$nin\n operator in MongoDB.\n\n\n\n\nModel.find({\n  name: { '!' : ['walter', 'skyler'] }\n}).exec(function (err, everyoneExceptWaltersAndSkylers){\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nOr Pairs\n#\n\n\nUse the \nor\n modifier to match \nany\n of the nested rulesets you specify as an array of query pairs.

Any time a record is updated, or a new record is created, the data for each attribute will be checked against all of your predefined validation rules. This provides a convenient failsafe to ensure that invalid entries don't make their way into your app's database(s). \n\n\nExcept for \nunique\n (which is implemented as a database-level constraint; \nsee \"Unique\"\n), all validations below are implemented in JavaScript and run in the same Node.js server process as Sails.  Also keep in mind that, no matter what validations are used, an attribute must \nalways\n specify one of the built in data types ('string', 'number', json', etc).\n\n\n// User\nmodule.exports = {\n  attributes: {\n    emailAddress: {\n      type: 'string',\n      unique: true,\n      required: true\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Data Types\n#\n\n\nEvery attribute definition must have a built-in data type (or \ntypeclass\n) specified.  This is used for logical validation and coercion of results and criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((string))\n\n\ntype: 'string'\n\n\nAny string (tolerates \nnull\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((number))\n\n\ntype: 'number'\n\n\nAny number (tolerates \nnull\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((boolean))\n\n\ntype: 'boolean'\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n (also tolerates \nnull\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((json))\n\n\ntype: 'json'\n\n\nAny JSON-serializable value, including numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, dictionaries, and \nnull\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((array))\n\n\ntype: 'array'\n\n\nAny array consisting solelyof JSON-serializable contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent databases vary slightly in the way they handle edge cases and special values such as \nInfinity\n, \nnull\n, strings of varying lengths, etc.  Sails' ORM (Waterline) and its adapters perform loose validation to ensure that the values provided in criteria dictionaries and as values to \n.create()\n or \n.update()\n match the expected typeclass.\n\n\n\n\nNote that auto-migration also relies on the attribute's declared \ntype\n. This is mainly relevant for schemaful databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), since the relevant adapter needs to use this information in order to alter/define tables during auto-migration.  Remember that in production, \nmigrate: 'safe'\n will be enabled and auto-migration will be skipped.\n\n\n\n\nValidation Rules\n#\n\n\nThe following validation rules are handled by \nAnchor\n, a robust validation library for Node.js.\n\n\nIn the table below, the \"Compatible Attribute Type(s)\" column shows what data type(s) (i.e. for the attribute definition's \ntype\n property) are appropriate for each validation rule.  In many cases, a validation rule can be used with more than one type.

In fact, it isn't really a validation at all: it is a \ndatabase-level constraint\n.  More on that in a second.\n\n\nIf an attribute declares itself \nunique: true\n, then Sails ensures no two records will be allowed with the same value.  The canonical example is an \nemailAddress\n attribute on a \nUser\n model:\n\n\n// api/models/User.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  attributes: {\n    emailAddress: {\n      type: 'string',\n      unique: true,\n      required: true\n    }\n  }\n\n};\n\n\n\n\nWhy is \nunique\n different from other validations?\n#\n\n\nImagine you have 1,000,000 user records in your database.  If \nunique\n was implemented like other validations, every time a new user signed up for your app, Sails would need to search through \none million\n existing records to ensure that no one else was already using the email address provided by the new user.  Not only would that be slow, but by the time we finished searching through all those records, someone else could have signed up!\n\n\nFortunately, this type of uniqueness check is perhaps the most universal feature of \nany\n database.  To take advantage of that, Sails relies on the \ndatabase adapter\n to implement support for the \nunique\n validation-- specifically, by adding a \nuniqueness constraint\n to the relevant field/column/attribute in the database itself during \nauto-migration\n.  That is, while your app is set to \nmigrate:'alter'\n, Sails will automatically generate tables/collections in the underlying database with uniqueness constraints built right in.  Once you switch to \nmigrate:'safe'\n, updating your database constraints is up to you.\n\n\nWhat about indexes?\n#\n\n\nWhen you start using your production database, it is always a good idea to set up indexes to boost your database's performance.  The exact process and best practices for setting up indexes varies between databases, and is out of the scope of the documentation here.  That said if you've never done this before, don't worry-- it's \neasier than you might think\n.\n\n\nJust like everything else related to your production schema, once you set your app to use \nmigrate: 'safe'\n, Sails leaves database indexes entirely up to you.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this means you should be sure to update your indexes alongside your uniqueness constraints when performing \nmanual migrations\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Use Validations\n#\n\n\nValidations can be a huge time-saver, preventing you from writing many hundreds of lines of repetitive code.  But keep in mind that model validations are run for \nevery create or update\n in your application.  Before using a validation rule in one of your attribute definitions, make sure you are OK with it being applied \nevery time\n your application calls \n.create()\n or \n.update()\n to specify a new value for that attribute.  If that is \nnot\n the case, write code that validates the incoming values inline in your controller; or call out to a custom function in one of your \nservices\n, or a \nmodel class method\n.\n\n\nFor example, let's say that your Sails app allows users to sign up for an account by either (A) entering an email address and password and then confirming that email address or (B) signing up with LinkedIn.  Now let's say your \nUser\n model has one attribute called \nlinkedInEmail\n and another attribute called \nmanuallyEnteredEmail\n.  Even though \none\n of those email address attributes is required, \nwhich one\n is required depends on how a user signed up.  So in that case, your \nUser\n model cannot use the \nrequired: true\n validation-- instead you'll need to validate that one email or the other was provided and is valid by manually checking these values before the relevant \n.create()\n and \n.update()\n calls in your code, e.g.:\n\n\nif ( !_.isString( req.param('email') ) ) {\n  return res.badRequest();\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo take this one step further, now let's say your application accepts payments.  During the sign up flow, if a user signs up with a paid plan, he or she must also provide an email address for billing purposes (\nbillingEmail\n).  If a user signs up with a free account, he or she skips that step.  On the account settings page, users on a paid plan do see a \"Billing Email\" form field where they can customize their billing address.

Don't be afraid to forgo built-in validation support and check values by hand in your controllers or in a helper function.  Oftentimes this is the cleanest and most maintainable approach.\n- There's nothing wrong with adding or removing validations from your models as your app evolves. But once you go to production, there is one \nvery important exception\n: \nunique\n.  During development, when your app is configured to use \nmigrate: 'alter'\n, you can add or remove \nunique\n validations at will.  However, if you are using \nmigrate: safe\n (e.g. with your production database), you will want to update constraints/indices in your database, as well as \nmigrate your data by hand\n.\n- It is a very good idea to spend the time to fully understand your application's user interface \nfirst\n before setting up complex validations on your model attributes.\n\n\n\n\nAs much as possible, it is a good idea to obtain or flesh out your own wireframes of your app's user interface \nbefore\n you spend any serious amount of time implementing \nany\n backend code.  Of course, this isn't always possible- and that's what the \nblueprint API\n is for.  Applications built with a UI-centric, or \"front-end first\" philosophy are easier to maintain, tend to have fewer bugs and, since they are built with full knowledge of the user interface from the get-go, they often have more elegant APIs.\n\n\n\n\nCustom Validation Rules\n#\n\n\n\n\nWarning:\n Support for custom validation rules as documented here will very likely be ending in Waterline 1.0.  To future-proof your app, use a function from one of your \nservices\n or a \nmodel class method\n for custom validation instead.\n\n\n\n\nYou can define your own custom validation rules by specifying a \ntypes\n dictionary as a top level property of your model, then use them in your attribute definitions just like you could any other validation rule above:\n\n\n// api/models/User.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  // Values passed for creates or updates of the User model must obey the following rules:\n  attributes: {\n\n    firstName: {\n      // Note that a base type (in this case \"string\") still has to be defined, even though validation rules are in use.\n      type: 'string',\n      required: true,\n      minLength: 5,\n      maxLength: 15\n    },\n\n    location: {\n      type: 'json',\n      isPoint: true // << defined below\n    },\n\n    password: {\n      type: 'string',\n      password: true // << defined below\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  // Custom types / validation rules\n  // (available for use in this model's attribute definitions above)\n  types: {\n    isPoint: function(value){\n      // For all creates/updates of `User` records that specify a value for an attribute\n      // which declares itself `isPoint: true`, that value must:\n      // \u2022 be a dictionary with numeric `x` and `y` properties\n      // \u2022 both `x` and `y` must be neither `Infinity` nor `-Infinity`\n      return _.isObject(value) &&\n      _.isNumber(value.x) && _.isNumber(value.y) &&\n      value.x !== Infinity && value.x !== -Infinity &&\n      value.y !== Infinity && value.y !== -Infinity;\n    },\n    password: function(value) {\n      // For all creates/updates of `User` records that specify a value for an attribute\n      // which declares itself `type: 'password'`, that value must:\n      // \u2022 be a string\n      // \u2022 be at least 6 characters long\n      // \u2022 contain at least one number\n      // \u2022 contain at least one letter\n      return _.isString(value) && value.length >= 6 && value.match(/[a-z]/i) && value.match(/[0-9]/);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCustom validation functions receive the incoming value being validated as their first argument, and are expected to return \ntrue\n if it is valid, \nfalse\n otherwise.  Once set up, these custom validation rules can be used in one or more attributes in the model where they are defined by setting an extra property with the same name in relevant attribute definitions; e.g. \nsomeCustomValidationRuleOrType: true\n.\n\n\nNote that custom validation rules are not namespaced from built-in validations and types-- they are all merged together. So be careful not to define a custom validation that collides with any of the base types or validations in Waterline (e.g. don't name your custom validation rule \nstring\n or \nminLength\n).\n\n\nCustom Validation Messages\n#\n\n\nOut of the box, Sails.js does not support custom validation messages.  Instead your code should look at validation errors in the callback from your \ncreate()\n or \nupdate()\n calls and take the appropriate action; whether that's sending a particular error code in your JSON response or rendering the appropriate message in an HTML error page.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Sails v0.11.0+, you may want to take advantage of \nsails-hook-validation\n, a \ncustom hook\n by \n@lykmapipo\n.

Not only would that be slow, but by the time we finished searching through all those records, someone else could have signed up!  Fortunately, this type of uniqueness check is perhaps the most universal feature of  any  database.  To take advantage of that, Sails relies on the  database adapter  to implement support for the  unique  validation-- specifically, by adding a  uniqueness constraint  to the relevant field/column/attribute in the database itself during  auto-migration .  That is, while your app is set to  migrate:'alter' , Sails will automatically generate tables/collections in the underlying database with uniqueness constraints built right in.

But keep in mind that model validations are run for  every create or update  in your application.  Before using a validation rule in one of your attribute definitions, make sure you are OK with it being applied  every time  your application calls  .create()  or  .update()  to specify a new value for that attribute.  If that is  not  the case, write code that validates the incoming values inline in your controller; or call out to a custom function in one of your  services , or a  model class method .  For example, let's say that your Sails app allows users to sign up for an account by either (A) entering an email address and password and then confirming that email address or (B) signing up with LinkedIn.  Now let's say your  User  model has one attribute called  linkedInEmail  and another attribute called  manuallyEnteredEmail .  Even though  one  of those email address attributes is required,  which one  is required depends on how a user signed up.  So in that case, your  User  model cannot use the  required: true  validation-- instead you'll need to validate that one email or the other was provided and is valid by manually checking these values before the relevant  .create()  and  .update()  calls in your code, e.g.:  if ( !_.isString( req.param('email') ) ) {\n  return res.badRequest();\n}  To take this one step further, now let's say your application accepts payments.  During the sign up flow, if a user signs up with a paid plan, he or she must also provide an email address for billing purposes ( billingEmail ).  If a user signs up with a free account, he or she skips that step.

This includes everything from \nattribute definitions\n, to the \ndatabase settings\n the model will use, as well as a number of other options.\n\n\nThe majority of this page is devoted to a complete tour of the model settings supported by Sails.  But before we begin, let's look at how to actually apply these settings in a Sails app.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nModel settings allow you to customize the behavior of the models in your Sails app.  They can be specified on a per-model basis by setting top-level properties in a \nmodel definition\n, or as app-wide defaults in \nsails.config.models\n.\n\n\nChanging default model settings\n#\n\n\nTo modify the \ndefault model settings\n shared by all of the models in your app, edit \nconfig/models.js\n.\n\n\nFor example, if you edit \nconfig/models.js\n so that it contains \nconnection: 'somePostgresqlDb'\n, then, assuming you've defined a connection named \nsomePostgresqlDb\n, you'll set PostgreSQL as your default database.  In other words, unless overridden, all of your app's models will use that PostgreSQL datastore any time built-in model methods like \n.create()\n or \n.find()\n are executed.\n\n\nOverriding settings for a particular model\n#\n\n\nTo further customize these settings for a particular model, you can specify them as top-level properties in that model's definition file (e.g. \napi/models/User.js\n).  This will override default model settings with the same name.\n\n\nFor example, if you add \nautoUpdatedAt: false\n to one of your model definitions (\napi/models/UploadedFile.js\n), then that model will no longer have an implicit \nupdatedAt\n attribute.  But the rest of your models will be unaffected; they will still use the default setting (which is \nautoUpdatedAt: true\n, unless you've changed it).\n\n\nWhich approach should I use?\n#\n\n\nBy convention, attribute definitions are specified in individual model files.  Most other model settings, like \nschema\n and \nconnection\n, should be specified app-wide unless you need to override them for a particular model; for example, if your default datastore is PostgreSQL, but you have an \nCachedBloodworkReport\n model that you want to live in Redis.\n\n\nNow that you know what model settings are in general, and how to configure them, let's run through and have a look at each one.\n\n\n\n\nmigrate\n#\n\n\nmigrate: 'safe'\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmigrate\n setting controls the \nauto-migration strategy\n that Sails will run every time your app loads.  In short, this tells Sails whether or not you'd like it to attempt to automatically rebuild the tables/collections/sets/etc. in your database(s).\n\n\nDatabase migrations\n#\n\n\nIn the course of developing an app, you will almost always need to make at least one or two \nbreaking changes\n to the structure of your database.  Exactly \nwhat\n constitutes a \"breaking change\" depends on the database you're using:  For example, imagine you add a new attribute to one of your model definitions.  If that model is configured to use MongoDB, then this is no big deal; you can keep developing as if nothing happened.  But if that model is configured to use MySQL, then there is an extra step: a column must be added to the corresponding table (otherwise model methods like \n.create()\n will stop working.)  So for a model using MySQL, adding an attribute is a breaking change to the database schema.\n\n\n\n\nEven if all of your models use MongoDB, there are still some breaking schema changes to watch out for.  For example, if you add \nunique: true\n to one of your attributes, a \nunique index\n must be created in MongoDB.\n\n\n\n\nIn Sails, there are two different modes of operation when it comes to \ndatabase migrations\n:\n\n\n\n\nManual migrations\n - The art of updating your database tables/collections/sets/etc. by hand.  For example, writing a SQL query to \nadd a new column\n, or sending a \nMongo command to create a unique index\n.  If the database contains data you care about (in production, for example), you must carefully consider whether that data needs to change to fit the new schema, and, if necessary, write scripts to migrate it.  A \nnumber of\n great \nopen-source tools\n exist for managing manual migration scripts, as well as hosted products like the \ndatabase migration service on AWS\n.\n\n\nAuto-migrations\n - A convenient, built-in feature in Sails that allows you to make iterative changes to your model definitions during development, without worrying about the reprecussions.  Auto-migrations should \nnever\n be enabled when connecting to a database with data you care about.  Instead, use auto-migrations with fake data, or with cached data that you can easily recreate.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you need to apply breaking changes to your \nproduction database\n, you should use manual database migrations. But otherwise, when you're developing on your laptop, or running your automated tests, auto-migrations can save you tons of time.\n\n\nHow auto-migrations work\n#\n\n\nWhen you lift your Sails app in a development environment (e.g. running \nsails lift\n in a brand new Sails app), the configured auto-migration strategy will run.  If you are using \nmigrate: 'safe'\n, then nothing extra will happen at all.  But if you are using \ndrop\n or \nalter\n, Sails will load every record in your development database into memory, then drop and recreate the physical layer representation of the data (i.e. tables/collections/sets/etc.)  This allows any breaking changes you've made in your model definitions, lik removing a uniqueness constraint, to be automatically applied to your development database.  Finally, if you are using \nalter\n, Sails will then attempt to re-seed the freshly generated tables/collections/sets with the records it saved earlier.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto-migration strategy\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsafe\n\n\nnever auto-migrate my database(s). I will do it myself, by hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalter\n\n\nauto-migrate columns/fields, but attempt to keep my existing data (experimental)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrop\n\n\nwipe/drop ALL my data and rebuild models every time I lift Sails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I use auto-migrations in production?\n#\n\n\nThe \ndrop\n and \nalter\n auto-migration strategies in Sails exist as a feature for your convenience during development, and when running automated tests.  \nThey are not designed to be used with data you care about.\n  Please take care to never use \ndrop\n or \nalter\n with a production dataset.  In fact, as a failsafe to help protect you from doing this inadvertently, any time you lift your app \nin a production environment\n, Sails \nalways\n uses \nmigrate: 'safe'\n, no matter what you have configured.\n\n\nIn many cases, hosting providers automatically set the \nNODE_ENV\n environment variable to \"production\" when they detect a Node.js app.  Even so, please don't rely only on that failsafe, and take the usual precautions to keep your users' data safe.  Any time you connect Sails (or any other tool or framework) to a database with pre-existing production data, \ndo a dry run\n.  Especially the very first time.  Production data is sensitive, valuable, and in many cases irreplaceable.  Customers, users, and their lawyers are not cool with it getting flushed.\n\n\nAs a best practice, make sure to never lift or \ndeploy\n your app with production database credentials unless you are 100% sure you are running in a production environment.  A popular approach for solving this organization-wide is simply to \nnever\n push up production database credentials to your source code repository in the first place, and instead relying on \nenvironment variables\n for all sensitive credentials.  (This is an especially good idea if your app is subject to regulatory requirements, or if a large number of people have access to your code base.) \n\n\nAre auto-migrations slow?\n#\n\n\nIf you are working with a relatively large amount of development/test data, the \nalter\n auto-migration strategy may take a long time to complete at startup.  If you notice that a command like \nnpm test\n, \nsails console\n, or \nsails lift\n appears to hang, consider decreasing the size of your development dataset.  (Remember: Sails auto-migrations should only be used on your local laptop/desktop computer, and only with small, development datasets.)\n\n\nschema\n#\n\n\nschema: true\n\n\n\n\nA flag to toggle schemaless or schema mode in databases that support schemaless data structures. If turned off, this will allow you to store arbitrary data in a record. If turned on, only attributes defined in the model's \nattributes\n object will be stored.\n\n\nFor adapters that don't require a schema, such as Mongo or Redis, the default setting is \nschema:false\n.\n\n\nconnection\n#\n\n\nconnection: 'my-local-postgresql'\n\n\n\n\nThe configured database \nconnection\n where this model will fetch and save its data.  Defaults to \nlocalDiskDb\n, the default connection that uses the \nsails-disk\n adapter.\n\n\nidentity\n#\n\n\nidentity: 'purchase'\n\n\n\n\nThe lowercase unique key for this model, e.g. \nuser\n.  By default, a model's \nidentity\n is inferred automatically by lowercasing its filename.  You should never change this property on your models.\n\n\nglobalId\n#\n\n\nglobalId: 'Purchase'\n\n\n\n\nThis flag changes the global name by which you can access your model (if the globalization of models is enabled).  You should never change this property on your models. To disable globals, see \nsails.config.globals\n.\n\n\nautoPK\n#\n\n\nautoPK: true\n\n\n\n\nA flag to toggle the automatic definition of a primary key in your model. The details of this default PK vary between adapters (e.g. MySQL uses an auto-incrementing integer primary key, whereas MongoDB uses a randomized string UUID).  In any case, the primary keys generated by autoPK will be unique. If turned off no primary key will be created by default, and you will need to define one manually, e.g.:\n\n\nattributes: {\n  sku: {\n    type: 'string',\n    primaryKey: true,\n    unique: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nautoCreatedAt\n#\n\n\nautoCreatedAt: true\n\n\n\n\nIf set to \nfalse\n, this disables the automatic definition of a \ncreatedAt\n attribute in your model.  By default, \ncreatedAt\n is an attribute which will be automatically set when a record is created with the current (timezone-agnostic) timestamp.   If set to a string, that string will be used as the custom field/column name for the \ncreatedAt\n attribute.\n\n\nautoUpdatedAt\n#\n\n\nautoUpdatedAt: true\n\n\n\n\nIf set to \nfalse\n, this disables the automatic definition of an \nupdatedAt\n attribute in your model.  By default, \nupdatedAt\n is an attribute which will be automatically set with the current (timezone-agnostic) timestamp every time a record is updated.  If set to a string, that string will be used as the custom field/column name for the \nupdatedAt\n attribute.\n\n\ntableName\n#\n\n\ntableName: 'some_preexisting_table'\n\n\n\n\nYou can define a custom name for the physical collection in your adapter by adding a \ntableName\n attribute. \nThis isn't just for tables\n.  In MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. this setting refers to the name of the table, but in MongoDB or Redis, it refers to the collection, and so forth. If no tableName is specified, Waterline will use the model's \nidentity\n as its \ntableName\n.\n\n\nThis is particularly useful for working with pre-existing/legacy databases.\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n#\n\n\nattributes: {\n  name: { type: 'string' },\n  email: { type: 'email' },\n  age: { type: 'integer' }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSee \nAttributes\n.",

If the relationship contains sensitive patient information (for instance, a relationship between \nPatient\n and \nMedicine\n) you want to be sure that all relevant data is saved in one particular database over the other (in this case, \nPatient\n is likely to be \ndominant\n).\n\n\nAlong the same lines, if one of your connections is read-only (perhaps \nMedicine\n in the previous example is connected to a read-only vendor database), you won't be able to write to it, so you'll want to make sure your relationship data can be persisted safely on the other side.\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n#\n\n\nWhat if one of the collections doesn't have \nvia\n?\n#\n\n\n\n\nIf a \ncollection\n association does not have a \nvia\n property, it is automatically \ndominant: true\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if both collections don't have \nvia\n?\n#\n\n\n\n\nIf both \ncollections\n don't have \nvia\n, then they are not related.  Both are \ndominant\n, because they are separate relationship tables!!\n\n\n\n\nWhat about \nmodel\n associations?\n#\n\n\n\n\nIn all other types of associations, the \ndominant\n property is prohibited.  Setting one side to \ndominant\n is only necessary for associations between two models which have an attribute like: \n{ via: '...', collection: '...' }\n on both sides.\n\n\n\n\nCan a model be dominant for one attribute and not another?\n#\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that a model is \"dominant\" only in the context of a particular relationship.  A model may be dominant in one or more relationships (attributes) while simultaneously NOT being dominant in other relationships (attributes).\ne.g. if a \nUser\n has a collection of toys called \nfavoriteToys\n via \nfavoriteToyOf\n on the \nToy\n model, and \nfavoriteToys\n on \nUser\n is \ndominant: true\n, \nToy\n can still be dominant in other ways.  So \nToy\n might also be associated to \nUser\n by way of its attribute, \ndesignedBy\n, for which it is \ndominant: true\n.\n\n\n\n\nCan both models be dominant?\n#\n\n\n\n\nNo. If both models in a cross-adapter/cross-connection, many-to-many association set \ndominant: true\n, an error is thrown before lift.\n\n\n\n\nCan neither model be dominant?\n#\n\n\n\n\nSort of... If neither model in a cross-adapter/cross-connection, many-to-many association sets \ndominant: true\n, a warning is displayed before lift, and a guess will be made automatically based on the characteristics of the relationship.  For now, that just means an arbitrary decision based on alphabetical order :)\n\n\n\n\nWhat about non-cross-adapter associations?\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndominant\n property is silently ignored in non-cross-adapter/cross-connection associations.  We're assuming you might be planning on breaking up the schema across multiple connections eventually, and there's no reason to prevent you from being proactive.

You can also use an array of previous values.\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \n.save()\n a populate call will be performed to return the newly saved data to you.

For example, if you were building Dropbox, before letting a user upload a file to a folder, you might check that she \nisAuthenticated\n, then ensure that she \ncanWrite\n (has write permissions on the folder.)  Finally, you'd want to check that the folder she's uploading into \nhasEnoughSpace\n.\n\n\nPolicies can be used for anything: HTTP BasicAuth, 3rd party single-sign-on, OAuth 2.0, or your own custom authorization/authentication scheme.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: policies apply \nonly\n to controller actions, not to views.  If you define a route in your \nroutes.js config file\n that points directly to a view, no policies will be applied to it.  To make sure policies are applied, you can instead define a controller action which displays your view, and point your route to that action. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWriting Your First Policy\n#\n\n\nPolicies are files defined in the \napi/policies\n folder in your Sails app.  Each policy file should contain a single function.\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it, policies are really just Connect/Express middleware functions which run \nbefore\n your controllers.  You can chain as many of them together as you like-- in fact they're designed to be used this way.  Ideally, each middleware function should really check just \none thing\n.\n\n\nFor example, the \ncanWrite\n policy mentioned above might look something like this:\n\n\n// policies/canWrite.js\nmodule.exports = function canWrite (req, res, next) {\n  var targetFolderId = req.param('id');\n\n  // If the requesting user is not logged in, then they are _never_ allowed to write.\n  // No reason to continue-- we can go ahead and bail out now.\n  if (!req.session.me) {\n    return res.redirect('/login');\n  }\n\n  // Check the database to see if a permission record exists which matches both the\n  // target folder id, the appropriate \"type\", and the id of the logged-in user.\n  Permission.findOne({\n    folder: targetFolderId,\n    user: req.session.me,\n    type: 'write'\n  })\n  .exec(function (err, permission) {\n\n    // Unexpected error occurred-- use the app's default error (500) handler.\n    //\n    // > We do this because this should never happen, and if it does, it means there\n    // > is probably something wrong with our database, and we want to know about it!)\n    if (err) { return res.serverError(err); }\n\n    // No \"write\" permission record exists linking this user to this folder.\n    // Maybe they got removed from it?  Or maybe they never had permission in the first place...\n    if (!permission) {\n      return res.redirect('/login');\n    }\n\n    // If we made it all the way down here, looks like everything's ok, so we'll let the user through.\n    // (from here, the next policy or the controller action will run)\n    return next();\n\n  });\n};\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Controllers with Policies\n#\n\n\nSails has a built in ACL (access control list) located in \nconfig/policies.js\n.  This file is used to map policies to your controllers.\n\n\nThis file is  \ndeclarative\n, meaning it describes \nwhat\n the permissions for your app should look like, not \nhow\n they should work.  This makes it easier for new developers to jump in and understand what's going on, plus it makes your app more flexible as your requirements inevitably change over time.\n\n\nYour \nconfig/policies.js\n file should export a Javascript object whose keys are controller names (or \n'*'\n for  global policies), and whose values are objects mapping action names to one or more policies.  See below for more details and examples.\n\n\nTo apply a policy to a specific controller action:\n#\n\n\n{\n  ProfileController: {\n      // Apply the 'isLoggedIn' policy to the 'edit' action of 'ProfileController'\n      edit: 'isLoggedIn'\n      // Apply the 'isAdmin' AND 'isLoggedIn' policies, in that order, to the 'create' action\n      create: ['isAdmin', 'isLoggedIn']\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo apply a policy to an entire controller:\n#\n\n\n{\n  ProfileController: {\n    // Apply 'isLoggedIn' by default to all actions that are NOT specified below\n    '*': 'isLoggedIn',\n    // If an action is explicitly listed, its policy list will override the default list.\n    // So, we have to list 'isLoggedIn' again for the 'edit' action if we want it to be applied.\n    edit: ['isAdmin', 'isLoggedIn']\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Default policy mappings do not \"cascade\" or \"trickle down.\"  Specified mappings for the controller's actions will override the default mapping.\n\n\n\n\nTo apply a policy to all actions that are not explicitly mapped:\n#\n\n\n{\n  // Apply 'isLoggedIn' to all actions by default\n  '*': 'isLoggedIn',\n  ProfileController: {\n      // Apply 'isAdmin' to the 'foo' action.  'isLoggedIn' will NOT be applied!\n      'foo': 'isAdmin'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, default policies will not be applied to any controller / action that is given an explicit mapping.\n\n\n\n\nUsing policies with blueprint actions\n#\n\n\nSails' built-in \nblueprint API\n is implemented using regular Sails controller actions.  The only difference is that blueprint actions are implicit.\n\n\nTo apply your policies to blueprint actions, set up your policy mappings just like we did in the example above, but pointed at name of the relevant implicit \nblueprint action\n in your controller.  For example:\n\n\n{\n  UserController: {\n    // Apply the 'isLoggedIn' policy to the 'update' action of 'UserController'\n    update: 'isLoggedIn'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in policies\n#\n\n\nSails provides two built-in policies that can be applied globally, or to a specific controller or action.\n  + \ntrue\n: public access  (allows anyone to get to the mapped controller/action)\n  +  \nfalse\n: \nNO\n access (allows \nno-one\n to access the mapped controller/action)\n\n\n'*': true\n is the default policy for all controllers and actions.  In production, it's good practice to set this to \nfalse\n to prevent access to any logic you might have inadvertently exposed.\n\n\nAdding some policies to a controller:\n#\n\n\n  // in config/policies.js\n\n  // ...\n  RabbitController: {\n\n    // Apply the `false` policy as the default for all of RabbitController's actions\n    // (`false` prevents all access, which ensures that nothing bad happens to our rabbits)\n    '*': false,\n\n    // For the action `nurture`, apply the 'isRabbitMother' policy\n    // (this overrides `false` above)\n    nurture : 'isRabbitMother',\n\n    // Apply the `isNiceToAnimals` AND `hasRabbitFood` policies\n    // before letting any users feed our rabbits\n    feed : ['isNiceToAnimals', 'hasRabbitFood']\n  }\n  // ...\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the \nisNiceToAnimals\n policy from above might look like (this file would be located at \npolicies/isNiceToAnimals.js\n):\n\n\nmodule.exports = function isNiceToAnimals (req, res, next) {\n\n  // `req.session` contains a set of data specific to the user making this request.\n  // It's kind of like our app's \"memory\" of the current user.\n\n  // If our user has a history of animal cruelty, not only will we\n  // prevent her from going even one step further (`return`),\n  // we'll go ahead and redirect her to PETA (`res.redirect`).\n  if ( req.session.user.hasHistoryOfAnimalCruelty ) {\n    return res.redirect('http://PETA.org');\n  }\n\n  // If the user has been seen frowning at puppies, we have to assume that\n  // they might end up being mean to them, so we'll\n  if ( req.session.user.frownsAtPuppies ) {\n    return res.redirect('http://www.dailypuppy.com/');\n  }\n\n  // Finally, if the user has a clean record, we'll call the `next()` function\n  // to let them through to the next policy or our controller\n  next();\n};\n\n\n\n\nBesides protecting rabbits (while a noble cause, no doubt), here are a few other use cases for policies:\n+ cookie-based authentication\n+ role-based access control\n+ limiting file uploads based on MB quotas\n+ any other kind of authentication scheme you can imagine",

However, Sails apps can also be started and manipulated from within other Node apps, using the \nprogrammatic interface\n.  One of the main uses for this interface is to run Sails apps inside of automated test suites.\n\n\nCreating a Sails app programmatically\n#\n\n\nTo create a new Sails app from within a Node.js script, use the Sails \nconstructor\n.  You can use the same constructor to create as many distinct Sails apps as you like:\n\n\nvar Sails = require('sails').constructor;\nvar mySailsApp = new Sails();\nvar myOtherSailsApp = new Sails();\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring, starting and stopping Sails apps programmatically\n#\n\n\nOnce you have a reference to a new Sails app, you can use \n.load()\n or \n.lift()\n to start it.  Both methods take two arguments: a dictionary of configuration options, and a callback function that will be run after the Sails app starts.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sails is started programmatically, it will still use the \napi\n, \nconfig\n and other folders underneath the current working directory to load controllers, models, and configuration options.  One notable exception is that \n.sailsrc\n files will \nnot\n be loaded when starting apps this way.\n\n\nAny configuration options sent as arguments to \n.load()\n or \n.lift()\n will take precedence over options loaded from anywhere else.\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between \n.load()\n and \n.lift()\n is that \n.lift()\n takes the additional steps of (1) running the app's \nbootstrap\n, if any, and (2) starting an HTTP server on the port configured via \nsails.config.port\n (1337 by default).  This allows you to make HTTP requests to the lifted app.  To make requests to an app started with \n.load()\n, you can use the \n.request()\n method of the loaded app.\n\n\n.lift()\n#\n\n\nStarting an app with .lift() on port 1338 and sending a POST request via HTTP:\n\n\nvar request = require('request');\nvar Sails = require('sails').constructor;\n\nvar mySailsApp = new Sails();\nmySailsApp.lift({\n  port: 1338\n  // Optionally pass in any other programmatic config overrides you like here.\n}, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Failed to lift app.  Details:', err);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // --\u2022\n  // Make a request using the \"request\" library and display the response.\n  // Note that you still must have an `api/controllers/FooController.js` file\n  // under the current working directory, or a `/foo` or `POST /foo` route\n  // set up in `config/routes.js`.\n  request.post('/foo', function (err, response) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.log('Could not send HTTP request.

Details:', err);\n    }\n    else {\n      console.log('Got response:', response);\n    }\n\n    // >--\n    // In any case, whether the request worked or not, now we need to call `.lower()`.\n    mySailsApp.lower(function (err) {\n      if (err) {\n        console.log('Could not lower Sails app.  Details:',err);\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // --\u2022\n      console.log('Successfully lowered Sails app.');\n\n    });//</lower sails app>\n  });//</send virtual request to sails app>\n});//</load sails app (but not lift!)>\n\n\n\n\n.lower()\n#\n\n\nTo stop an app programmatically, use \n.lower()\n:\n\n\nmySailsApp.lower(function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n     console.log('An error occured when attempting to stop app:', err);\n     return;\n  }\n\n  // --\u2022\n  console.log('Lowered app successfully.');\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nReference\n#\n\n\nThe full reference for Sails' programmatic interface is available in \nReference > Application\n.",

This means that a client (e.g. browser tab, Raspberry Pi, etc) can maintain a persistent connection to a Sails backend, and messages can be sent from client to server (e.g. AJAX) or from server to client (e.g. \"comet\") at any time.  Two common uses of realtime communication are live chat implementations and multiplayer games.  Sails implements realtime on the server using the \nsocket.io\n library, and on the client using the \nsails.io.js\n library.  Throughout the Sails documentation, the terms \nsocket\n and \nwebsocket\n are commonly used to refer to a two-way, persistent communication channel between a Sails app and a client.\n\n\nCommunicating with a Sails app via sockets is similar to using AJAX, in that both methods allow a web page to interact with the server without refreshing.  However, sockets differ from AJAX in two important ways: first, a socket can stay connected to the server for as long as the web page is open, allowing it to maintain \nstate\n (AJAX requests, like all HTTP requests, are \nstateless\n).  Second, because of the always-on nature of the connection, a Sails app can send data down to a socket at any time (hence the \"realtime\" moniker), whereas AJAX only allows the server to respond when a request is made.\n\n\nRealtime model updates with resourceful pub-sub\n#\n\n\nSockets making requests to Sails' \nblueprint actions\n are automatically subscribed to realtime messages about the models they retrieve via the \nresourceful pub-sub API\n.  You can also use this API in your custom controller actions to send out messages to clients interested in certain models.\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\nConnect a client-side socket to the server, subscribe to the \nuser\n event, and request \n/user\n to subscribe to current and future User model instances.\n\n\n<!-- Simply include the sails.io.js script, and a client socket will be created for you -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// The automatically-created socket is exposed as io.socket.\n// Use .on() to subscribe to the 'user' event on the client.\n// This event is sent by the Sails \"create\", \"update\",\n// \"delete\", \"add\" and \"remove\" blueprints to any socket that\n// is subscribed to one or more User model instances.\nio.socket.on('user', function gotHelloMessage (data) {\n  console.log('User alert!', data);\n});\n// Using .get('/user') will retrieve a list of current User models,\n// subscribe this socket to those models, AND subscribe this socket\n// to notifications about new User models when they are created.\nio.socket.get('/user', function gotResponse(body, response) {\n  console.log('Current users: ', body);\n})\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nCustom realtime communication with \nsails.sockets\n#\n\n\nSails exposes a rich API on both the client and the server for sending custom realtime messages.\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\nHere's the client-side code to connect a socket to the Sails/Node.js server and listen for an socket event named \"hello\":\n\n\n<!-- Simply include the sails.io.js script, and a client socket will be created and auto-connected for you -->\n<script type\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\"></script>\n<script type\"text/javascript\">\n\n// The auto-connecting socket is exposed as `io.socket`.\n\n// Use `io.socket.on()` to listen for the 'hello' event:\nio.socket.on('hello', function (data) {\n  console.log('Socket `' + data.id + '` joined the party!');\n});\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nThen, also on the client, we can send a \nsocket request\n.  In this case, we'll wire up the browser to send a socket request when a particular button is clicked:\n\n\n$('button#say-hello').click(function (){\n\n  // And use `io.socket.get()` to send a request to the server:\n  io.socket.get('/say/hello', function gotResponse(data, jwRes) {\n    console.log('Server responded with status code ' + jwRes.statusCode + ' and data: ', data);\n  });\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the server...\n\n\nTo respond to requests to \nGET /say/hello\n, we use an action.  In our action, we'll subscribe the requesting socket to the \"funSockets\" room, then broadcast a \"hello\" message to all sockets in that room (excluding the new one).\n\n\n// In /api/controllers/SayController.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  hello: function(req, res) {\n\n    // Make sure this is a socket request (not traditional HTTP)\n    if (!req.isSocket) {\n      return res.badRequest();\n    }\n\n    // Have the socket which made the request join the \"funSockets\" room.\n    sails.sockets.join(req, 'funSockets');\n\n    // Broadcast a notification to all the sockets who have joined\n    // the \"funSockets\" room, excluding our newly added socket:\n    sails.sockets.broadcast('funSockets', 'hello', { howdy: 'hi there!'}, req);\n\n    // ^^^\n    // At this point, we've blasted out a socket message to all sockets who have\n    // joined the \"funSockets\" room.  But that doesn't necessarily mean they\n    // are _listening_.  In other words, to actually handle the socket message,\n    // connected sockets need to be listening for this particular event (in this\n    // case, we broadcasted our message with an event name of \"hello\").  The\n    // client-side you'd need to write looks like this:\n    // ```\n    // io.socket.on('hello', function (broadcastedData){\n    //   console.log(data.howdy);\n    //   // => 'hi there!'\n    // }\n    // ```\n\n    // Now that we've broadcasted our socket message, we still have to continue on\n    // with any other logic we need to take care of in our action, and then send a\n    // response.  In this case, we're just about wrapped up, so we'll continue on\n\n    // Respond to the request with a 200 OK.\n    // The data returned here is what we received back on the client as `data` in:\n    // `io.socket.get('/say/hello', function gotResponse(data, jwRes) { /* ... */ });`\n    return res.json({\n      anyData: 'we want to send back'\n    });\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nReference\n#\n\n\n\n\nSee the full reference for the \nsails.io.js library\n to learn how to use sockets on the client side to communicate with your Sails app.\n\n\nSee the \nsails.sockets\n reference to learn how to send custom messages from the server to connected sockets.\n\n\nSee the \nresourceful pub-sub\n reference to learn how Sails' blueprint API automatically sends realtime messages about changes to your \nmodels\n.\n\n\nVisit the \nSocket.io\n website to learn more about the underlying library Sails uses for realtime communication",

This means that a client (e.g. browser tab, Raspberry Pi, etc) can maintain a persistent connection to a Sails backend, and messages can be sent from client to server (e.g. AJAX) or from server to client (e.g. \"comet\") at any time.  Two common uses of realtime communication are live chat implementations and multiplayer games.  Sails implements realtime on the server using the  socket.io  library, and on the client using the  sails.io.js  library.  Throughout the Sails documentation, the terms  socket  and  websocket  are commonly used to refer to a two-way, persistent communication channel between a Sails app and a client.  Communicating with a Sails app via sockets is similar to using AJAX, in that both methods allow a web page to interact with the server without refreshing.  However, sockets differ from AJAX in two important ways: first, a socket can stay connected to the server for as long as the web page is open, allowing it to maintain  state  (AJAX requests, like all HTTP requests, are  stateless ).

            "text": "Custom Routes\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nSails allows you to explicitly route URLs in several different ways in your \nconfig/routes.js\n file.  Every route configuration consists of an \naddress\n and a \ntarget\n, for example:\n\n\n'GET /foo/bar': 'FooController.bar'\n^^^address^^^^  ^^^^^^target^^^^^^^\n\n\n\n\nRoute Address\n#\n\n\nThe route address indicates what URL should be matched in order to apply the handler and options defined by the target.  A route consists of an optional verb and a mandatory path:\n\n\n'POST  /foo/bar'\n^verb^ ^^path^^\n\n\n\n\nIf no verb is specified, the route will match any CRUD method (\nGET\n, \nPUT\n, \nPOST\n, \nDELETE\n or \nPATCH\n).  If \nALL\n is specified as the verb, the route will match \nany\n method.\n\n\nNote the initial \n/\n in the path--all paths should start with one in order to work properly.\n\n\nWildcards and dynamic parameters\n#\n\n\nIn addition to specifying a static path like \nfoo/bar\n, you can use \n*\n as a wildcard:\n\n\n'/*'\n\n\n\n\nwill match all paths, where as:\n\n\n'/user/foo/*'\n\n\n\n\nwill match all paths that \nstart\n with \n/user/foo\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using a route with a wildcard, such as \n'/*'\n, be aware that this will also match requests to static assets (i.e. \n/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n) and override them. To prevent this, consider using the \nskipAssets\n option \ndescribed below\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou can capture the parts of the address that are matched by wildcards into named parameters by using the \n:paramName\n wildcard syntax instead of the \n*\n:\n\n\n'/user/foo/bar/:name'\n\n\n\n\nWill match \nalmost\n the same URLs as:\n\n\n'/user/foo/bar/*'\n\n\n\n\nbut will provide the value of the dynamic portions of the route URL to the route handler as parameter values.  In this case: \nreq.param('name')\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the wildcard (\n*\n) syntax matches slashes, where the URL pattern variable (\n:\n) syntax does not.  So in the example above, given the route address \nGET /user/foo/bar/*\n, incoming requests with URLs like \n/user/foo/bar/baz/bing/bong/bang\n would match (whereas if you used the \n:name\n syntax, the same URL would not match.)\n\n\n\n\nRegular expressions in addresses\n#\n\n\nIn addition to the wildcard address syntax, you may also use Regular Expressions to define the URLs that a route should match.  The syntax for defining an address with a regular expression is:\n\n\n\"r|<regular expression string>|<comma-delimited list of param names>\"\n\n\nThat's the letter \"\nr\n\", followed by a pipe character \n|\n, a regular expression string \nwithout delimiters\n, another pipe, and a list of parameter names that should be mapped to parenthesized groups in the regular expression.  For example:\n\n\n\"r|^/\\\\d+/(\\\\w+)/(\\\\w+)$|foo,bar\": \"MessageController.myaction\"\n\n\nWill match \n/123/abc/def\n, running the \nmyaction\n action of \nMessageController\n and supplying the values \nabc\n and \ndef\n as \nreq.param('foo')\n and \nreq.param('bar')\n, respectively.\n\n\nNote the double-backslash in \n\\\\d\n and \n\\\\w\n; this escaping is necessary for the regular expression to work correctly!\n\n\nAbout route ordering\n#\n\n\nWhen using wildcards or regular expressions in your addresses, keep in mind that the ordering of your routes in \nconfig/routes.js\n matters; URLs are matched against addresses in the list from the top down.  If you have two configurations in this order:\n\n\n'/user': 'UserController.doSomething',\n'/*'   : 'CatchallController.doSomethingElse'\n\n\n\n\nthen a request to \n/user\n will not be matched by the second configuration unless the first configuration's handler calls \nnext()\n in its code, which is discouraged (only \npolicies\n should call \nnext()\n).  Unless you're doing something very advanced, it is safe to assume that every request will be handled by at most one route in your \nconfig/routes.js\n file.\n\n\nRoute Target\n#\n\n\nThe address portion of a custom route specifies which URLs the route should match.  The \ntarget\n portion specifies what Sails should do after the match is made.  A target can take one of several different forms.  In some cases you may want to chain multiple targets to a single address by placing them in an array, but in most cases each address will have only one target.  The different types of targets are discussed below, followed by a discussion of the various options that can be applied to them.\n\n\nController / action target syntax\n#\n\n\nThe most common type of target is one which binds a route to a custom \ncontroller action\n.  The following four routes are equivalent:\n\n\n'GET /foo/go': 'FooController.myGoAction',\n'GET /foo/go': 'Foo.myGoAction',\n'GET /foo/go': {controller: \"Foo\", action: \"myGoAction\"},\n'GET /foo/go': {controller: \"FooController\", action:\"myGoAction\"},\n\n\n\n\nEach one maps \nGET /foo/go\n to the \nmyGoAction\n action of the controller in \napi/controllers/FooController.js\n.  If no such controller or action exists, Sails will output an error message and ignore the route.  Otherwise, whenever a \nGET\n request to \n/foo/go\n is made, the code in that action will be run.\n\n\nThe controller and action names in this syntax are case-insensitive.\n\n\nNote that the \nblueprint API\n adds several actions to your controllers by default (like \"find\", \"create\", \"update\" and \"delete\"), all of which are available for routing:\n\n\n'GET /foo/go': 'UserController.find'\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that your have a \napi/controllers/UserController.js\n file and a \napi/models/User.js\n file, browsing to \n/foo/go\n in a browser will, using the above config, run the default \"find* blueprint action which displays a list of all \nUser\n models.  If you have a \ncustom action\n named \nfind\n in UserController, that action will be run instead.\n\n\nView target syntax\n#\n\n\nAnother common target is one that binds a route to a \nview\n.  This is particularly useful for binding static views to a custom URL, and it's how the default homepage for new projects is set up out of the box.\n\n\nThe syntax for view targets is simple: it is just the path to the view file, without the file extension (e.g. \n.ejs\n) and relative to the \nviews/\n folder :\n\n\n'GET /team': {view: 'brochure/about'}\n\n\n\n\nThis tells Sails to handle \nGET\n requests to \n/team\n by serving the view template located at \nviews/brochure/about.ejs\n (assuming the default EJS \ntemplate engine\n is used).  As long as that view file exists, a \nGET\n request to  \n/home\n will display it. For consistency with Express/consolidate, if the specified relative path does not match a view file, then Sails will look for a sub-folder with the same name (e.g. \npages/brochure\n) and serve the \"index\" view in that sub-folder (e.g. \npages/brochure/index.ejs\n) if one exists.\n\n\n\n\nNote that since this route is bound directly to the view, none of your configured policies will be applied.  If you need to configure a policy, use \nres.view()\n from a controller action.  See \nthis StackOverflow question\n for more background information.\n\n\n\n\nBlueprint target syntax\n#\n\n\nIn some cases you may want to map a non-standard address to one of the Sails \nblueprint actions\n.  For example, if you have a controller and model named \nUserController\n and \nUser\n respectively, then Sails will automatically map \nGET /user\n to the \"find\" blueprint action which returns a list of User records.  If you'd like to map a different address to that action, you can use the blueprint target syntax:\n\n\n'GET /findAllUsers': {model: 'user', blueprint: 'find'},\n'GET /user/findAll': {blueprint: 'find'}\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the configuration, both the \nmodel\n and \nblueprint\n properties are set, while in the second one, only \nblueprint\n is used.  In the second configuration, leaving off the \nmodel\n property causes Sails to examine the address and guess that the model is \nUser\n.  You could override this by explicitly setting \nmodel\n to something else:\n\n\n'GET /user/findAll': {blueprint: 'find', model: 'pet'}\n\n\n\n\nalthough you will rarely if ever want to do this, as it makes for a messy and confusing API for your app.\n\n\nIf you specify a non-existent model or blueprint in your configuration, Sails will output an error and ignore the route.\n\n\nYou can also use this syntax to map a route to one of the default blueprint actions even if you've overridden that action in a controller.\n\n\nRedirect target syntax\n#\n\n\nYou can have one address redirect to another--either within your Sails app, or on another server entirely--you can do so just by specifying the redirect URL as a string:\n\n\n'/alias' : '/some/other/url'\n\n\n\n\nBe careful to avoid redirect loops when redirecting within your Sails app!\n\n\nNote that when redirecting, the HTTP method of the original request (and any extra headers / parameters) will likely be lost, and the request will be transformed to a simple \nGET\n request.  In the above example, a \nPOST\n request to \n/alias\n will result in a \nGET\n request to \n/some/other/route\n.  This is somewhat browser-dependent behavior, but it is recommended that you don't expect request methods and other data to survive a redirect.\n\n\nResponse target syntax\n#\n\n\nYou can map an address directly to a default or custom \nresponse\n using this syntax:\n\n\n'/foo': {response: 'notFound'}\n\n\n\n\nSimply specify the name of the response file in your \napi/responses\n folder, without the \n.js\n extension.  The response name in this syntax is case-sensitive.  If you attempt to bind a route to a non-existent response, Sails will output an error and ignore the route.\n\n\nPolicy target syntax\n#\n\n\nIn most cases, you will want to apply \npolicies\n to your controller actions using the \nconfig/policies.js\n config file.  However, there are some times when you will want to apply a policy directly to a custom route: particularly when you are using the \nview\n or [blueprint]((http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/Routes/RouteTargetSyntax.html?q=blueprint-target-syntax) target syntax.  The policy target syntax is:\n\n\n'/foo': { policy: 'myPolicy' }\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you will always want to chain the policy to at least one other type of target, using an array:\n\n\n'/foo': [\n  { policy: 'myPolicy' },\n  { controller: 'user', action: 'find' }\n]\n\n\n\n\nThis will apply the \nmyPolicy\n policy to the route and, if it passes, continue by running the \nfind\n blueprint for the \nUser\n model.\n\n\nFunction target syntax\n#\n\n\nFor quick-and-dirty jobs (useful for quick tests), you can assign a route directly to a function:\n\n\n'/foo': function(req, res) { return res.send('hello!'); }\n\n\n\n\nYou can also combine this syntax with others using an array, allowing you to define quick, inline middleware:\n\n\n'/foo': [\n  function(req, res, next) {\n    sails.log('Quick and dirty test:', req.allParams());\n    return next();\n  },\n  { controller: 'user', action: 'find' }\n]\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use a dictionary with an \nfn\n key to assign a function.  This allows you to also specify \nother route target  options\n at the same time:\n\n\n'GET /*': {\n  fn: function(req, res) {\n    return res.send('hello!');\n  },\n  skipAssets: true\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practice is to use the function syntax only for temporary routes, since it goes against the structural conventions that make Sails useful!  (Plus, the less cluttered your routes.js file, the better.)\n\n\n\n\nRoute target options\n#\n\n\nIn addition to the options discussed in the various route target syntaxes above, any other property you add to a route target object will be passed through to the route handler in the \nreq.options\n object.  There are several reserved properties that can be used to affect the behavior of the route handlers.  These are listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nApplicable Target Types\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskipAssets\n\n\nall\n\n\n((boolean))\n\n\nSet to \ntrue\n if you \ndon't\n want the route to match URLs with dots in them (e.g. \nmyImage.jpg\n).  This will keep your routes with \nwildcard notation\n from matching URLs of static assets.  Useful when creating \nURL slugs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskipRegex\n\n\nall\n\n\n((regexp))\n\n\nIf skipping every URL containing a dot is too permissive, or you need a route's handler to be skipped based on different criteria entirely, you can use \nskipRegex\n.

As long as that view file exists, a  GET  request to   /home  will display it. For consistency with Express/consolidate, if the specified relative path does not match a view file, then Sails will look for a sub-folder with the same name (e.g.  pages/brochure ) and serve the \"index\" view in that sub-folder (e.g.  pages/brochure/index.ejs ) if one exists.

When Sails receives an incoming request, it checks the \naddress\n of all custom routes for matches.  If a matching route is found, the request is then passed to its \ntarget\n.\n\n\nFor example, we might read \n'get /me': 'UserController.profile'\n as:\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey Sails, when you receive a GET request to \nhttp://mydomain.com/me\n, run the \nprofile\n action of \nUserController\n, would'ya?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I want to change the view layout within the route itself?

Like \nJSONP\n, the goal of CORS is to circumvent the \nsame-origin policy\n; allowing your Sails server to successfully respond to requests from client-side JavaScript code running on a page hosted from some other domain.  But unlike JSONP, it works with more than just GET requests.  And it allows you to whitelist particular origins (\nstaging.yoursite.com\n or \nyourothersite.net\n) and prevent requests from others (\nevil.com\n).\n\n\nSails can be configured to allow cross-origin requests from a list of domains you specify, or from every domain.  This can be done on a per-route basis, or globally for every route in your app.\n\n\nEnabling CORS\n#\n\n\nFor security reasons, CORS is disabled by default in Sails.  But enabling it is dead-simple.\n\n\nTo allow cross-origin requests from a whitelist of trusted domains to \nany\n route in your app, simply enable \nallRoutes\n and provide an \norigin\n setting in \nconfig/cors.js\n:\n\n\nallRoutes: true,\norigin: 'example.com,api.example.com,blog.example.com,foo.com'\n\n\n\n\nTo allow cross-origin requests from \nany\n domain to \nany\n route in your app, use \norigin: '*'\n:\n\n\nallRoutes: true,\norigin: '*',\ncredentials: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING:\n#\n\n\nIf you enable CORS with \norigin: '*'\n, but fail to also set \ncredentials: false\n, your app will \nnot\n be protected against attacks that exploit CORS.  To prevent third-party sites from being able to trick your logged-in users into making unauthorized requests to your app, you should either (A) set \norigin\n to a specific set of trusted domains, or (B) keep \norigin: '*'\n but set \ncredentials: false\n.  Just realize that, if you choose to set \ncredentials: false\n, affected routes will not be able to access the \nsession\n.\n\n\n\n\nSee \nsails.config.cors\n for a comprehensive reference of all available options.\n\n\nConfiguring CORS For individual routes\n#\n\n\nBesides the global CORS configuration in \nconfig/cors.js\n, you can also configure these settings on a per-route basis in \nconfig/routes.js\n.\n\n\nIf you set \nallRoutes: true\n in \nconfig/cors.js\n, but you want to exempt a specific route, set the \ncors: false\n in the route's target:\n\n\n'POST /signup': {\n   controller: 'UserController',\n   action: 'signup',\n   cors: false\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo enable or override global CORS configuration for a particular route, provide \ncors\n as a dictionary:\n\n\n'GET /videos': {\n   controller: 'VideoController',\n   action: 'find',\n   cors: {\n     origin: 'example.com,api.example.com,blog.example.com,foo.com',\n     credentials: false\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSecurity levels\n#\n\n\nThe browser's cross-origin policy allows requests to be sent-- it simply does not allow the browser to receive the response.  Similarly, Sails will still process all the requests that come in regardless of domain, even with CORS enabled.  But for routes with CORS enabled, it will simply set the appropriate headers on the response so that the \nbrowser\n can decide whether or not to expose the response.  For example, if you send a \nGET\n request to \n/foo/bar\n from a domain that is not in your CORS whitelist (\norigin\n), the \nbar\n action in your \nFooController.js\n file will still run, but the browser will throw away the result.  This may seem counterintuitive, but it is important because it allows non-browser-based clients (like \nPostman\n and \ncurl\n) to work while still blocking the kind of attacks that the \nSame-Origin Policy\n is meant to protect against.\n\n\nIf you want to completely prevent Sails from processing requests from disallowed domains, you can use the \nsecurityLevel\n setting:\n\n\nmodule.exports.cors = {\n  allRoutes: true,\n  origin: \"http://sailsjs.org\",\n  securityLevel: 1\n}\n\n\n\n\nSecurity level 1 (high) will respond with a 403 status code to any request from a disallowed origin prefixed with the \nhttp\n or \nhttps\n protocol.

Let's say that on Monday, Mary and Muhammad both make purchases.  In order to do so, our site needed to dispense at least two different CSRF tokens- one for Mary and one for Muhammad.  From then on, if our web backend received a request with a missing or incorrect token, that request will be rejected. So now we can rest assured that when Mary navigates away to play online poker, the 3rd party website cannot trick the browser into sending malicious requests to our site using her cookies.\n\n\nDispensing CSRF tokens\n#\n\n\nTo get a CSRF token, you should either bootstrap it in your view using \nlocals\n (good for traditional multi-page web applications) or fetch it using sockets or AJAX from a special protected JSON endpoint (handy for single-page-applications (SPAs).)\n\n\nUsing view locals:\n#\n\n\nFor old-school form submissions, it's as easy as passing the data from a view into a form action.  You can grab hold of the token in your view, where it may be accessed as a view local: \n<%= _csrf %>\n\n\ne.g.:\n\n\n<form action=\"/signup\" method=\"POST\">\n <input type=\"text\" name=\"emailaddress\"/>\n <input type='hidden' name='_csrf' value='<%= _csrf %>'>\n <input type='submit'>\n</form>\n\n\n\n\nIf you are doing a \nmultipart/form-data\n upload with the form, be sure to place the \n_csrf\n field before the \nfile\n input, otherwise you run the risk of a timeout and a 403 firing before the file finishes uploading.\n\n\nUsing AJAX/WebSockets\n#\n\n\nIn AJAX/Socket-heavy apps, you might prefer to send a GET request to the built-in \n/csrfToken\n route, where it will be returned as JSON, e.g.:\n\n\n{\n  \"_csrf\": \"ajg4JD(JGdajhLJALHDa\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nSpending CSRF tokens\n#\n\n\nOnce you've enabled CSRF protection, any POST, PUT, or DELETE requests (\nincluding\n virtual requests, e.g. from Socket.io) made to your Sails app will need to send an accompanying CSRF token as a header or parameter.  Otherwise, they'll be rejected with a 403 (Forbidden) response.\n\n\nFor example, if you're sending an AJAX request from a webpage with jQuery:\n\n\n$.post('/checkout', {\n  order: '8abfe13491afe',\n  electronicReceiptOK: true,\n  _csrf: 'USER_CSRF_TOKEN'\n}, function andThen(){ ... });\n\n\n\n\nWith some client-side modules, you may not have access to the AJAX request itself. In this case, you can consider sending the CSRF token directly in the URL of your query. However, if you do so, remember to URL-encode the token before spending it:\n\n\n..., {\n  checkoutAction: '/checkout?_csrf='+encodeURIComponent('USER_CSRF_TOKEN')\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose to send the CSRF token as the \nX-CSRF-Token\n header instead of the \n_csrf\n parameter.\n\n\nFor most developers and organizations, CSRF attacks need only\u00a0be a concern if you allow users to log into/securely access your Sails backend \nfrom the browser\n (i.e. from your HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end code).

            "text": "Understanding Sessions in Sails\n#\n\n\nFor our purposes \nsessions\n are synonymous with a few components that together allow you to store information about a user agent between requests.\n\n\n\n\nA \nuser agent\n is the software (e.g. browser or native application) that represents you on a device (e.g. a browser tab on your computer, a smartphone application, or your refrigerator).  It is associated one-to-one with a cookie or access token.\n\n\n\n\nSessions can be very useful because the request/response cycle is \nstateless\n. The request/response cycle is considered stateless because neither the client nor the server inherently stores any information between different requests about a particular request.  Therefore the lifecycle of a request/response ends when a response is made to the requesting user agent (e.g. \nres.send()\n).\n\n\nNote, we\u2019re going to discuss sessions in the context of a browser user agent. While you can use sessions in Sails for whatever you like, it is generally a best practice to use it purely for storing the state of user agent authentication. Authentication is a process that allows a user agent to prove that they have a certain identity.  For example, in order to access some protected functionality, I might need to prove that my browser tab actually corresponds with a particular user record in a database.  If I provide you with a unique name and a password, you can look up the name and compare my password with a stored (hopefully \nencrypted\n) password.  If there's a match, I'm authenticated. But how do you store that \"authenticated-ness\" between requests? That's where sessions come in.\n\n\nWhat sessions are made of\n#\n\n\nThere are three main components to the implementation of sessions in Sails:\n1. the \nsession store\n where information is retained\n2. the middleware that manages the session\n3. a cookie that is sent along with every request and stores a session id (by default, \nsails.sid\n)\n\n\nThe \nsession store\n can either be in memory (e.g. the default Sails session store) or in a database (e.g. Sails has built-in support for using Redis for this purpose).  Sails builds on top of Connect middleware to manage the session; which includes using a \ncookie\n to store a session id (\nsid\n) on theuser agent.\n\n\nA day in the life of a \nrequest\n, a \nresponse\n, and a \nsession\n#\n\n\nWhen a \nrequest\n is sent to Sails, the request header is parsed by the session middleware.  \n\n\nScenario 1: The request header has no \ncookie property\n#\n\n\nIf the header does not contain a cookie property, a \nsid\n is created in the session and a default session dictionary is added to \nreq\n (e.g. \nreq.session\n).  At this point you can make changes to the session property (usually in a controller/action).  For example, let's look at the following \nlogin\n action.\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  login: function(req, res) {\n\n    // Authentication code here\n\n    // If successfully authenticated\n\n    req.session.userId = foundUser.id;   // returned from a database\n\n    return res.json(foundUser);\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere we added a \nuserId\n property to \nreq.session\n.  \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The property will not be stored in the \nsession store\n nor available to other requests until the response is sent.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the response is sent, any new requests will have access to \nreq.session.userId\n. Since we didn't have a cookie \nproperty\n in the request header a cookie will be established for us.  \n\n\nScenario 2: The request header has a cookie \nproperty\n with a \nSails.sid\n#\n\n\nNow when the user agent makes the next request, the \nSails.sid\n stored on the cookie is checked for authenticity and if it matches an existing \nsid\n in the session store, the contents of the session store is added as a property on the \nreq\n dictionary (e.g. \nreq.session\n).  We can access properties on \nreq.session\n (e.g. \nreq.session.me\n) or add properties to it (e.g. \nreq.session.me == someValue\n).  The values in the session store might change but generally the \nSails.sid\n and \nsid\n do not change.\n\n\nWhen does the \nSails.sid\n change?\n#\n\n\nBy default, the Sails session store is \nin memory\n.  Therefore, when you close the Sails server, the current session store moves on to session heaven (e.g. the session store disappears).  When Sails is restarted, although a user agent request contains a \nSails.sid\n in the cookie, the \nsid\n is no longer in the session store.  Therefore, a new \nsid\n will be generated and replaced in the cookie.  The \nSails.sid\n will also change if the user agent cookie expires or is removed.\n\n\n\n\nThe lifespan of a Sails cookie can be changed from its default setting (e.g. never expires) to a new setting by accessing the \ncookie.maxAge\n property in \nprojectName/config/session.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nRedis\n as the session store\n#\n\n\nRedis is a key-value database package that can be used as a session store that is separate from the Sails instance.  This configuration for sessions has two benefits.  The first is that the session store will remain viable between Sails restarts.  The second is that if you have multiple Sails instances behind a load balancer, all of the instances can point to a single consolidated session store.\n\n\nTo enable Redis as a session store open \nprojectName/config/session.js\n in your favorite text editor and uncomment the \nadapter\n property.  That's it.  During development as long as you have a Redis instance running on the same machine as your Sails instance your session store will use Redis.  You can point to a different Redis instance by configuring the following optional properties in \nprojectName/config/session.js\n:\n\n\n  // host: 'localhost',\n  // port: 6379,\n  // ttl: <redis session TTL in seconds>,\n  // db: 0,\n  // pass: <redis auth password>,\n  // prefix: 'sess:',\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on configuring these properties go to \nhttps://github.com/tj/connect-redis\n.\n\n\nNerdy details of how the session cookie is created\n#\n\n\nThe value for the cookie is created by first hashing the \nsid\n with a configurable \nsecret\n which is just a long string.\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the session \nsecret\n property in \nprojectName/config/session.js\n. \n\n\n\n\nThe Sails \nsid\n (e.g. \nSails.sid\n) then becomes a combination of the plain \nsid\n followed by a hash of the \nsid\n plus the \nsecret\n.  To take this out of the world of abstraction, let's use an example.  Sails creates a \nsid\n of \n234lj232hg234jluy32UUYUHH\n and a \nsession secret\n of \n9238cca11a83d473e10981c49c4f\n. These values are simply two strings that Sails combine and hash to create a \nsignature\n of \nAuSosBAbL9t3Ev44EofZtIpiMuV7fB2oi\n.  So the \nSails.sid\n becomes \n234lj232hg234jluy32UUYUHH.AuSosBAbL9t3Ev44EofZtIpiMuV7fB2oi\n and is stored in the user agent cookie by sending a \nset-cookie\n property in the response header. \n\n\nWhat does this prevent?\n It prevents a user from guessing the \nsid\n as well as prevents a evil doer from spoofing a user into making an authetication request with a \nsid\n that the evil doer knows.  This could allow the evil doer to use the \nsid\n to do bad things while the user is authenticated via the session.",

The first is that the session store will remain viable between Sails restarts.

To enable Redis as a session store open  projectName/config/session.js  in your favorite text editor and uncomment the  adapter  property.  That's it.  During development as long as you have a Redis instance running on the same machine as your Sails instance your session store will use Redis.  You can point to a different Redis instance by configuring the following optional properties in  projectName/config/session.js :    // host: 'localhost',\n  // port: 6379,\n  // ttl: <redis session TTL in seconds>,\n  // db: 0,\n  // pass: <redis auth password>,\n  // prefix: 'sess:',  For more information on configuring these properties go to  https://github.com/tj/connect-redis .",

You can change the session  secret  property in  projectName/config/session.js .    The Sails  sid  (e.g.  Sails.sid ) then becomes a combination of the plain  sid  followed by a hash of the  sid  plus the  secret .  To take this out of the world of abstraction, let's use an example.  Sails creates a  sid  of  234lj232hg234jluy32UUYUHH  and a  session secret  of  9238cca11a83d473e10981c49c4f . These values are simply two strings that Sails combine and hash to create a  signature  of  AuSosBAbL9t3Ev44EofZtIpiMuV7fB2oi .  So the  Sails.sid  becomes  234lj232hg234jluy32UUYUHH.AuSosBAbL9t3Ev44EofZtIpiMuV7fB2oi  and is stored in the user agent cookie by sending a  set-cookie  property in the response header.   What does this prevent?  It prevents a user from guessing the  sid  as well as prevents a evil doer from spoofing a user into making an authetication request with a  sid  that the evil doer knows.  This could allow the evil doer to use the  sid  to do bad things while the user is authenticated via the session.",

            "location": "/concepts/Upgrading/To0.10/",
            "text": "Upgrading to v0.10\n#\n\n\nFor the most part, running sails lift in an existing v0.9 project should just work. The core contributors have taken a number of steps to make the upgrade as easy as possible, and if you follow the deprecation messages in the console, you should do just fine.\n\n\nSails v0.10 comes with some big changes. The sections below provide a high level overview of what's changed, major bug fixes, enhancements and new features, as well as a basic tutorial on how to upgrade your v0.9.x Sails app to v0.10.\n\n\nFile uploads\n#\n\n\nThe Connect multipart middleware \nwill soon be officially deprecated\n. But since this module was used as the built-in HTTP body parser in Sails v0.9 and Express v3, this is a breaking change for v0.9 Sails projects relying on \nreq.files\n.\n\n\nBy default in v0.10, Sails includes \nskipper\n, a body parser which allows for streaming file uploads without buffering tmp files to disk. For run-of-the-mill file upload use cases, Skipper comes with bundled support for uploads to local disk (via skipper-disk), but streaming uploads can be plugged in to any of its supported adapters.\n\n\nFor examples/documentation, please see the Skipper repository as well as the Sails documentation on \nreq.file()\n.\n\n\nWhy?\n#\n\n\nA body parser's job is to parse the \"body\" of incoming multipart HTTP requests. Sometimes, that \"body\" includes text parameters, but sometimes, it includes file uploads.\n\n\nConnect multipart is great code, and it supports both file uploads AND text parameters in multipart requests. But like most modules of its kind, it accomplishes this by buffering file uploads to disk. This can quickly overwhelm a server's available disk space, and in many cases exposes a serious DoS attack vulnerability.\n\n\nSkipper is unique in that it supports \nstreaming\n file uploads, but also maintains support for metadata in the request body (i.e. JSON/XML/urlencoded request body parameters). It uses a handful of heuristics to make sure only the files you're expecting get plugged in and received by the blob adapter, and other (potentially malicous) file fields are ignored.\n\n\n\n\n Important!\n#\n\n\nFor Skipper to work, you \nmust include all text parameters BEFORE file parameters\n in file upload requests to the server. Once Skipper sees the first file field, it stops waiting for text parameters (this is to avoid unnecessary/unsafe buffering of file data).\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring a different body parser\n#\n\n\nAs with most things in Sails, you can use any Connect/Express/Sails-compatible bodyparser you like. To switch back to \nconnect-multipart\n, or any other body parser (like \nformidable\n or \nbusboy\n), change your app's http configuration.\n\n\nBlueprints\n#\n\n\nA new blueprint action (\nfindOne\n) has been added. For instance, if you have a \nFooController\n and \nFoo\n model, then send a request to \n/foo/5\n, the \nfindOne\n action in your \nFooController\n will run. If you don't have a \nfindOne\n action, the \nfindOne\n blueprint action will be used in its stead. Requests sent to \n/foo\n will still run the find controller/blueprint action.\n\n\nPolicies\n#\n\n\nPolicies work exactly as they did in v0.9- however there is a new consideration you should take into account: Due to the introduction of the more specific \nfindOne()\n blueprint action mentioned above, you will want to make sure you're handling it explicitly in your policy mapping configuration.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you have a v0.9 app whose \npolicies.js\n configuration prevents access to the \nfind\n action in your \nDoveController\n:\n\n\nmodule.exports.policies = {\n  '*': true,\n  DoveController: {\n    find: false\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nAssuming rest blueprint routes are enabled, this would prevent access to requests like both \n/dove\n and \n/dove/14\n. But now in v0.10, since \n/dove/14\n will actually run the \nfindOne\n action, we must handle it explicitly:\n\n\nmodule.exports.policies = {\n  '*': true,\n  DoveController: {\n    find: false,\n    findOne: false\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nPubsub\n#\n\n\nSummary\n#\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n socket (i.e. \"comment\") event on client is now \nmodelIdentity\n (where \"modelIdentity\" is different depending on the model that the \npublish*()\n method was called from.\n\n\nClients are no longer subscribed to model-creation events by the blueprint routes. To listen for creation events, use \nModel.watch()\n.\n\n\nThe events that were formerly \ncreate\n, \nupdate\n, and \ndestroy\n are now \ncreated\n, \nupdated\n, and \ndestroyed\n.\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n#\n\n\nThe biggest change to pubsub is that Socket.io events are emitted under the name of the model emitting them. Previously, your client listened for the \nmessage\n event and then had to determine which model it came from based on the included data:\n\n\nsocket.on('message', function(cometEvent) {\n   if (cometEvent.model == 'user') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n   }\n   else if (cometEvent.model === 'product') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n   }\n   // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, you subscribe to the identity of the model:\n\n\nsocket.on('user', function(cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n});\n\nsocket.on('product', function (cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n});\n\n\n\n\nThis helps to structure your front end code.\n\n\nThe way you subscribe clients to models has also changed. Previously, you specified whether you were subscribing to the model class (class room) or one or more model instances based on the parameters that you passed to \nModel.subscribe\n. It was effectively one method to do two very different things.\n\n\nNow, you use \nModel.subscribe()\n to subscribe only to model instances (records). You can also specify event \"contexts\", or types, that you'd like to hear about. For example, if you only wanted to get messages about updates to an instance, you would call \nUser.subscribe(req, myUser, 'update')\n. If no context is given in a call to \n.subscribe()\n, then all contexts specified by the model class's autosubscribe property will be used.\n\n\nTo subscribe to model creation events, you can now use \nModel.watch()\n. Upon subscription, your clients will receive messages every time a new record is created on that model using the blueprint routes, and will automatically be subscribed to the new instance as well.\n\n\nRemember, when working with blueprints, clients are no longer auto subscribed to the class room. This must be done manually.\n\n\nFinally, if you want to see all pubsub messages from all models, you can access the \nfirehose\n, a development-only tool that broadcasts messages about \neverything\n that happens to your models. You can subscribe to the firehose using \nsails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose(socket)\n, or on the front end by making a socket request to \n/firehose\n. The firehose will broadcast a \nfirehose\n event whenever a model is created, updated, destroyed, added to, removed from or messaged. This effectively replaces the \nmessage\n event used in previous Sails versions.\n\n\nTo see examples of the new pubsub methods in action, see \nSailsChat\n.\n\n\nArguments to lifecycle callbacks are now typecasted\n#\n\n\nPreviously, with \nschema: true\n, if you sent an attribute value to a \n.create()\n or \n.update()\n that did not match the expected type declared in the model's attributes, the value you passed in would still be accessible in your model's lifecycle callbacks.\n\n\nIn Sails/Waterline v0.10, this is no longer the case. Values passed to \n.create()\n and \n.update()\n are type-casted before your lifecycle callbacks run. Affected lifecycle callbacks include \nbeforeUpdate()\n, \nbeforeCreate()\n, and \nbeforeValidate()\n.\n\n\nbeforeValidation() is now beforeValidate()\n#\n\n\nIf you were using the \nbeforeValidation\n or \nafterValidation\n model lifecycle callbacks in any of your models, you should change them to \nbeforeValidate\n or \nafterValidate\n. This change was made in Waterline to match the style of the other lifecycle callbacks (e.g. \nbeforeCreate\n, \nafterUpdate\n, etc.).\n\n\n.done() vs. .exec()\n#\n\n\n The old (/confusing?) meaning of \n.done()\n has been deprecated.\n\n\nIn Sails <= v0.8, the syntax for executing an ORM query was \nModel. [ \u2026 ] .done( cb )\n. In v0.9, when promise support was added, the \nModel. [ \u2026 ] .exec( cb )\n became the recommended replacement, since \n.done()\n has a special meaning in the promise spec. However, the original usage of \n.done()\n was left untouched to make upgrading from v0.8 to v0.9 easier.\n\n\nBut as of Sails/Waterline v0.10, the original meaning of \n.done()\n has been officially deprecated to allow for a more robust promise implementation going forward, and pluggable promise library support (e.g. choose \nQ\n or \nBluebird\n etc.).\n\n\nAssociations\n#\n\n\nSails v0.10 introduces associations between data models. Since the work we've done on associations is largely additive, your existing models should still just work. That said, this is a powerful new feature that allows you to write less code and makes your app more maintainable, so we suggest taking advantage of it! To learn about how to use associations in Sails, check out the docs.\n\n\nAssociations (or \"relations\") are really just special attributes. Instead of string or integer values, you can specify an instance of a model or a collection of model instances. You can think about this kind of like an object (\n{...}\n) or an array (\n[{...}, {...}]\n) you might store as JSON in a NoSQL database. The difference is, in Sails, this works with any of the supported databases, and even allows you to populate (i.e. join) across different databases and types of databases.\n\n\nGenerators\n#\n\n\nSails has had support for generating code for a while now (e.g. \nsails generate controller foo\n) but in v0.10, we wanted to make this feature more extensible, open, and accessible to everybody in the Sails community. With that in mind, v0.10 comes with a complete rewrite of the command-line tool, and pluggable generators. Want to be able to run \nsails generate blog foo\n to make a new blog built on Sails? Create a \nblog\n generator (run sails \ngenerate generator blog\n), add your templates, and configure the generator to copy the new templates over. Then you can release it to the community by publishing an npm module called \nsails-generate-blog\n. Compatibility with Yeoman generators is also in our roadmap.\n\n\nCommand-line tool\n#\n\n\nThe big change here is how you create a new api. In the past you called \nsails generate new_api\n. This would generate a new controller and model called \nnew_api\n in the appropriate places. This is now done using \nsails generate api new_api\n.\n\n\nYou can still generate models and controllers seperately using the same CLI Commands.\n\n\nAlso, \n--linker\n switch is no longer available. In previous version, if \n--linker\n switch was provided, it created a \nmyApp/assets/linker folder\n, with \njs\n, \nstyles\n and \ntemplates\n folders inside. In this new version, the \nmyApp/assets/linker\n folder is not created. Compiling CoffeeScript and Less is the default behavior now, right from the \nmyApp/assets/js\n and \nmyApp/assets/scripts\n folders.\n\n\nCustom server responses\n#\n\n\nIn v0.10, you can now generate your own custom server responses.\n\n\nLike before, there are a few that we automatically create for you. Instead of generating \nmyApp/config/500.js\n and other \n.js\n responses in the config directory, they are now generated in \nmyApp/api/responses/\n.\n\n\nTo migrate, you will need to create a new v0.10 project and copy the \nmyApp/api/responses\n directory into your existing app. You will then modify the appropriate .js file to reflect any customization you made in your response logic files (500.js,etc).\n\n\nLegacy data stored in the temporary sails-disk database\n#\n\n\nsails-disk\n, used by default in new Sails projects, now stores data a bit differently. If you have some temporary data stored in a 0.9.x project, you'll want to wipe it out and start fresh. To do this:\n\n\nFrom your project's root directory:\n\n\n$ rm .tmp/disk.db\n\n\n\n\nAdapter/Database Configuration\n#\n\n\nconfig.adapters\n (in \nmyApp/config/adapters.js\n) is now config.connections (in new projects, this is generated in \nmyApp/config/connections.js\n). Also, \nconfig.model\n is now \nconfig.models\n.\n\n\nYour app's default \nconnection\n (i.e. database) should now be configured as a string \nconfig.models.connection\n used by default for model. New projects are generated with a \n/config/models.js\n file that includes the default connection.\n\n\nTo configure a model to use specific adapters, you must now specify them in the \nconnection\n key instead of \nadapters\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    connection: ['someMongoDatabase'],\n\n    attributes: {\n        name:{\n            type     : 'string',\n            required : true\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\nBlueprints/Controller configuration\n#\n\n\nThe object literal describing controller configuration overrides for controller blueprints should change from:\n\n\n...\n_config: {\n  blueprints: {\n    rest: true,\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nto:\n\n\n...\n_config: {\n    rest: true,\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nLayout paths:\n#\n\n\nIn Sails v0.9, you could use the following syntax to specify \nauth/someLayout.ejs\n as a custom layout when rendering a view:\n\n\nreturn res.view('auth/login',{\n  layout: 'someLayout'\n});\n\n\n\n\nHowever in Sails v0.10, all layout paths are relative to your app's views path. In other words, the relative path of the layout is no longer resolved from the view's own path-- it is now always resolved from the views path. This makes it easier to understand which file is being used, particularly when layout files have similar names:\n\n\nreturn res.view('auth/login', {\n  layout: 'auth/someLayout'\n});",

Skipper is unique in that it supports  streaming  file uploads, but also maintains support for metadata in the request body (i.e. JSON/XML/urlencoded request body parameters).

Previously, your client listened for the  message  event and then had to determine which model it came from based on the included data:  socket.on('message', function(cometEvent) {\n   if (cometEvent.model == 'user') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n   }\n   else if (cometEvent.model === 'product') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n   }\n   // ...\n}  Now, you subscribe to the identity of the model:  socket.on('user', function(cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n});\n\nsocket.on('product', function (cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n});  This helps to structure your front end code.  The way you subscribe clients to models has also changed. Previously, you specified whether you were subscribing to the model class (class room) or one or more model instances based on the parameters that you passed to  Model.subscribe . It was effectively one method to do two very different things.  Now, you use  Model.subscribe()  to subscribe only to model instances (records). You can also specify event \"contexts\", or types, that you'd like to hear about. For example, if you only wanted to get messages about updates to an instance, you would call  User.subscribe(req, myUser, 'update') . If no context is given in a call to  .subscribe() , then all contexts specified by the model class's autosubscribe property will be used.  To subscribe to model creation events, you can now use  Model.watch() . Upon subscription, your clients will receive messages every time a new record is created on that model using the blueprint routes, and will automatically be subscribed to the new instance as well.  Remember, when working with blueprints, clients are no longer auto subscribed to the class room. This must be done manually.  Finally, if you want to see all pubsub messages from all models, you can access the  firehose , a development-only tool that broadcasts messages about  everything  that happens to your models. You can subscribe to the firehose using  sails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose(socket) , or on the front end by making a socket request to  /firehose . The firehose will broadcast a  firehose  event whenever a model is created, updated, destroyed, added to, removed from or messaged. This effectively replaces the  message  event used in previous Sails versions.  To see examples of the new pubsub methods in action, see  SailsChat .",

The biggest change is that Sails core is now using Socket.io v1.\n\n\nAlmost none of this should affect the existing code in project, but there are a few important differences and new features to be aware of.  We've listed them below.\n\n\nDifferences\n#\n\n\nUpgrade the Socket.io / Sails.io browser client\n#\n\n\nOld v0.9 socket.io client will no longer work, so consequently you'll need to upgrade your sails.io.js client from v0.9 or v0.10 to v0.11.\n\n\nTo do this, just remove your sails.io.js client and install the new one.  We've bundled a helper generator that will do this for you, assuming your sails.io.js client is in the conventional location at \nassets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n (i.e. if you haven't moved or renamed it):\n\n\nsails generate sails.io.js --force\n\n\n\n\nonConnect\n lifecycle callback\n#\n\n\n\n\ntldr;\n\n\nRemove your \nonConnect\n function from \nconfig/sockets.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nonConnect\n lifecycle callback\u00a0has been deprecated.  Instead, if you need to do something when a new socket is connected, send a request from the newly-connected client to do so.  The purpose of \nonConnect\n was always for optimizing performance (eliminating the need to do this initial extra round-trip with the server), yet its use can lead to confusion and race conditions. If you desperately need to eliminate the server roundtrip, you can bind a handler directly on \nsails.io.on('connect', function (newlyConnectedSocket){})\n in your bootstrap function (\nconfig/bootstrap.js\n). However, note that this is discouraged.  Unless you're facing \ntrue\n production performance issues, you should use the strategy mentioned above for your \"on connection\" logic (i.e. send an initial request from the client after the socket connects).  Socket requests are lightweight, so this doesn't add any tangible overhead to your application, and it will help make your code more predictable.\n\n\nonDisconnect\n lifecycle callback\n#\n\n\nThe \nonDisconnect\n lifecycle callback\u00a0has been deprecated in favor of \nafterDisconnect\n.\n\n\nIf you were using \nonDisconnect\n previously, you might have had to change the \nsession\n, then call \nsession.save()\n manually.  In v0.11, this works in almost exactly the same way, except that \nafterDisconnect\n receives an additional 3rd argument: a callback function.  This way, you can just call the provided callback when your \nafterDisconnect\n logic has finished, so that Sails can persist any changes you've made to the session automatically.  Finally, as you might expect, you won't need to call \nsession.save()\n manually anymore- it is now taken care of for you (just like \nreq.session\n in a normal route, action, or policy.)\n\n\n\n\ntldr;\n\nRename your \nonDisconnect\n function in \nconfig/sockets.js\n with the following:\n\n\nafterDisconnect: function (session, socket, cb) {\n  // Be sure to call the callback\n  return cb();\n}\n\n\n\n\nOther configuration in \nconfig/sockets.js\n#\n\n\nMany of the configuration options in Socket.io v1 have changed, so you'll want to update your \nconfig/sockets.js\n file accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nif you haven\u2019t customized any of the options in \nconfig/sockets.js\n for your app, you can safely remove or comment out the entire file and let the Sails defaults do their magic.  Otherwise, refer to the new \nSails sockets  documentation\n to ensure that your configuration is still valid and avoid unwanted hair loss.\n\n\nif you are scaling to multiple servers in an environment that does \nnot support sticky sessions\n (this includes Heroku), you'll need to set your \ntransports\n to \n['websocket']\n in both \nconfig/socket.js\n and your client--see \nour Scaling doc\n for more info.\n\n\nif you were using a custom \nauthorization\n function to restrict socket connections, you'll now want to use \nbeforeConnect\n.  \nauthorization\n was deprecated by Socket.io v1, but \nbeforeConnect\n (which maps to the \nallowRequest\n option from Engine.io) works just the same way.\n\n\nif you were using other low-level socket configuration that was passed directly to socket.io v1, be sure and check out the \nreference page on sailsjs.org\n where all of the new configuration options are covered in detail.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"firehose\"\n#\n\n\nThe \"firehose\" feature for testing with sockets has been deprecated.  If you don't know what that means, you have nothing to worry about. The basic usage will continue to work for a while, but it will soon be removed from core and should not be relied upon in your app.  This also applies to the following methods:\n  + sails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose()\n  + sails.sockets.unsubscribeFromFirehose()\n  + sails.sockets.drink()\n  + sails.sockets.spit()\n  + sails.sockets.squirt()\n\n\n\n\nIf you want the \"firehose\" back, let \nMike know on twitter\n (it can be brought back as a separate hook).\n\n\n\n\nConfig files in subfolders\n#\n\n\nIt has always been the intention that files in the Sails \nconfig\n folder have no precedence over each other, and that the filenames and subfolders (with the exception of \nlocal.js\n and the \nenv\n and \nlocale\n subfolders) be used merely for organization.  However, in previous Sails versions, saving config files in subfolders would have the effect that the filename would be added as a key in \nsails.config\n, so that if you saved some config in \nconfig/foo/bar.js\n, then that config would be namespaced under \nsails.config.bar\n.  This was unintentional and potentially confusing as 1) the directory name is ignored, and 2) moving the file would change the config key.  This has been fixed in v0.11.x: config files in subfolders will be treated the same as those in the root \nconfig\n folder.  If you are for some reason relying on the old behavior, you may set \ndontFlattenConfig\n to \ntrue\n in your \n.sailsrc\n file, but we would strongly recommend that you instead just namespace the config yourself by setting the desired key on \nmodule.exports\n; for example \nmodule.exports.foo = {...}\n.  See \nissue #2544\n for more details.\n\n\nWaterline now uses Bluebird\n#\n\n\nAs of v0.11, Waterline now supports Bluebird (instead of q) for promises.  If you are using \n.exec()\n you won't be affected-- only if you are using \n.then()\n.  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/1186 for more information.\n\n\nNew features\n#\n\n\nSails v0.11 also comes with some new stuff that we thought you'd like to know about:\n\n\nUser-level hooks\n#\n\n\nHooks can now be installed directly from NPM.\n\n\nThis means you can now install hooks with a single command in your terminal.  For instance, consider the \nautoreload\n hook\n by \n@sgress454\n, which watches for changes to your backend code so you don't need to kill and re-lift the server every time you change your controllers, routes, models, etc.\n\n\nTo install the \nautoreload\n hook, run:\n\n\nnpm install sails-hook-autoreload\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one example of what's possible.  As you might already know, hooks are the lowest-level pluggable abstraction in Sails.  They allow authors to tap into the lift process, listen for events, inject custom \"shadow\" routes, and, in general, take advantage of raw access to the \nsails\n runtime.\nMost of the features you're familiar with in Sails have actually already been implemented as \"core\" hooks for over a year, including:\n\n\n\n\nblueprints\n \n(which provides the blueprint API)\n\n\nsockets\n    \n(which provides socket.io integration)\n\n\ngrunt\n      \n(which provides Grunt integration)\n\n\norm\n        \n(which provides integration with the Waterline ORM, and imports your projects adapters, models, etc.)\n\n\nhttp\n       \n(which provides an HTTP server)\n\n\nand 16 others.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about how to write your own hooks in the \nnew and improved \"Extending Sails\" documentation\n on http://sailsjs.org.\n\n\nSocket.io v1.x\n#\n\n\nThe upgrade to Socket.io v1.0 shouldn't actually affect your app-level code, provided you are using the layer of abstraction provided by Sails itself; everything from the \nsails.sockets.*\n wrapper methods and \"up\" (resourceful pubsub, blueprints)\nIf you are using underlying socket.io methods in your apps, or are just curious about what changed in Socket.io v1.0, be sure and check out the \ncomplete Socket.io 1.0 migration guide\n from Guillermo and the socket.io team.\n\n\nEver-increasing modularity\n#\n\n\nAs part of the upgrade to Socket.io v1.0, we pulled out the core \nsockets\n hook into a separate repository.  This allowed us to write some modular, hook-specific tests for the socket.io interpreter, which will make things easier to maintain, customize, and override.\nThis also allows the hook to grow at its own pace, and puts related issues in one place.\n\n\nConsider this a test of the pros and cons of pulling other hooks out of the sails core repo over the next few months.  This will make Sails core lighter, faster, and more extensible, with fewer core dependencies, shorter \"lift\" time for most apps, and faster \nnpm install\ns.\n\n\nTesting, the \"virtual\" request interpreter, and the \nsails.request()\n method\n#\n\n\nIn the process of pulling the \nsockets\n hook \nout\n of core, the logic which interprets requests has been normalized and is now located \nin\n Sails core.  As a result, the \nsails.request()\n method is much more powerful.\n\n\nThis method allows you to communicate directly with the request interpreter in Sails without lifting your server onto a port.  It's the same mechanism that Sails uses to map incoming messages from Socket.io to \"virtual requests\" that have the familiar \nreq\n and \nres\n streams.\n\n\nThe primary use case for \nsails.request()\n is in writing faster-running unit and integration tests, but it's also handy for proxying to mounted apps (or \"sub-apps\").\n\n\nFor instance, here is an example (using mocha) of how you might test one of your app's routes:\n\n\nvar assert = require('assert');\nvar Sails = require('sails').Sails;\n\nbefore(function beforeRunningAnyTests (done){\n\n  // Load the app (no need to \"lift\" to a port)\n  sails.load({\n    log: {\n      level: 'warn'\n    },\n    hooks: {\n      grunt: false\n    }\n  }, function whenAppIsReady(err){\n    if (err) return done(err);\n\n    // At this point, the `sails` global is exposed, although we\n    // could have disabled it above with our config overrides to\n    // `sails.load()`. In fact, you can actually use this technique\n    // to set any configuration setting you like.\n    return done();\n  });\n});\n\nafter(function afterTestsFinish (done) {\n  sails.lower(done);\n});\n\ndescribe('GET /hotpockets', function (){\n\n  it('should respond with a 200 status code', function (done){\n\n    sails.request({\n      method: 'get',\n      url: '/hotpockets',\n      params: {\n        limit: 10,\n        sort: 'price ASC'\n      }\n    }, function (err, clientRes, body) {\n      if (err) return done(err);\n\n      assert.equal(clientRes.statusCode, 200);\n      return done();\n    });\n\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\nconfig/env/\n subfolders\n#\n\n\nIn v0.10.x, we added the \nconfig/env\n folder (thanks to \n@clarkorz\n), where you can add config files that will be loaded only in the appropriate environment (e.g. \nconfig/env/production.js\n for production environment, \nconfig/env/development\n for development, etc.).  In v0.11.x we've added the ability to specify whole subfolders per-environment.  For example, \nall\n config files saved to the \nconfig/env/production\n will be loaded and merged on top of other configuration when the environment is set to \nproduction\n.  Note that if both a \nconfig/env/production\n folder and a \nconfig/env/production.js\n file are present, the \nconfig/env/production.js\n settings will take precedence.  And, as always, \nlocal.js\n is merged on top of all other files, and \n.sailsrc\n rules them all.\n\n\nQuestions?\n#\n\n\nAs always, if you run into issues upgrading, or if any of the notes above don't make sense, let us know and we'll do what we can to clarify.\n\n\nFinally, to those of you that have contributed to the project since the v0.10 release in August: we can't stress enough how much we value your continued support and encouragement.  There is a pretty massive stream of issues, pull requests, documentation tweaks, and questions, but it always helps to know that we're in this together :)\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n-\n@mikermcneil\n, \n@sgress454\n and \n@particlebanana",

The purpose of  onConnect  was always for optimizing performance (eliminating the need to do this initial extra round-trip with the server), yet its use can lead to confusion and race conditions. If you desperately need to eliminate the server roundtrip, you can bind a handler directly on  sails.io.on('connect', function (newlyConnectedSocket){})  in your bootstrap function ( config/bootstrap.js ). However, note that this is discouraged.  Unless you're facing  true  production performance issues, you should use the strategy mentioned above for your \"on connection\" logic (i.e. send an initial request from the client after the socket connects).

You will find that this version is mostly backwards compatible with Sails v0.11, however there are some major changes to \nsails.sockets.*\n methods which may or may not affect your app. Most of the migration guide below deals with those changes, so if you are upgrading an existing app from v0.11 and are using \nsails.sockets\n methods, please be sure and carefully read the information below in case it affects your app.  Other than that, running \nsails lift\n in an existing project should just work.\n\n\nThe sections below provide a high level overview of what's changed, major bug fixes, enhancements and new features, as well as a basic tutorial on how to upgrade your v0.11.x Sails app to v0.12.\n\n\nInstalling the update\n#\n\n\nRun the following command from the root of your Sails app:\n\n\nnpm install sails@~0.12.0 --force --save\n\n\n\n\nThe \n--force\n flag will override the existing Sails dependency installed in your \nnode_modules/\n folder with the latest patch release of Sails v0.12, and the \n--save\n flag will update your package.json file so that future npm installs will also use the new version.\n\n\nThings to do immediately after upgrading\n#\n\n\n\n\nIf your app uses the \nsocket.io-redis\n adapter, upgrade to at least version 1.0.0 (\nnpm install --save socket.io-redis@^1.0.0\n).\n\n\nIf your app is using the Sails socket client (e.g. \nassets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n) on the front end, also install the newest version (\nsails generate sails.io.js --force\n)\n\n\n\n\nOverview of changes in v0.12\n#\n\n\n\n\nFor a full list of changes, see the changelog file for \nSails\n, as well as those for \nWaterline\n, \nsails-hook-sockets\n and \nsails.io.js\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity enhancements: updated several dependencies with potential vulnerabilities\n\n\nReverse routing functionality is now built in to Sails core via the new \nsails.getRouteFor()\n and \nsails.getUrlFor()\n methods\n\n\nGenerally improved multi-node support (and therefore scalability) of low-level \nsails.socket.*\n methods, and made additional adjustments and improvements related to the latest socket.io upgrade.  Added a much tighter Redis integration that sits on top of \nsocket.io-redis\n, using a redis client to implement cross-server communication rather than an additional socket client.\n\n\nCleaned up the API for \nsails.socket.*\n methods, normalizing overloaded functions and deprecating methods which cause problems in multiserver deployments (more on that below).\n\n\nAdded a few brand new sails.sockets methods: \n.leaveAll()\n, \n.addRoomMembersToRooms()\n, and \n.removeRoomMembersFromRooms()\n\n\nsails.sockets.id()\n is now \nsails.sockets.getId()\n (backwards compatible w/ deprecation message)\n\n\nNew Sails apps are now generated with the updated version of \nsails.io.js\n (the JavaScript Sails socket client).  This upgrade bundles the latest version of \nsocket.io-client\n, as well as some more advanced functionality (including the ability to specify common headers for all virtual socket requests)\n\n\nUpgraded to latest trusted versions of \ngrunt-contrib-*\n dependencies (eliminates many NPM deprecation warnings and provides better error messages from NPM).\n\n\nIf you are using NPM v3, running \nsails new\n will now run \nnpm install\n instead of symlinking your new app's initial dependencies.  This is slower than you may be used to, but is a necessary change due to changes in the way NPM handles nested dependencies.  The core maintainers are \nworking on\n a better long-term solution, but in the mean time if you run \nsails new\n a lot and the slowdown is bugging you, consider temporarily downgrading to an earlier version of NPM (v2.x).  If the installed version of NPM is < version 3, Sails will continue to take advantage of the classic symlinking strategy.\n\n\n\n\nSocket Methods\n#\n\n\nWithout question, the biggest change in Sails v0.12 is to the API of the low-level \nsails.sockets\n methods exposed by the \nsockets\n hook.  In order to ensure that Sails apps perform flawlessly in a \nmulti-server (aka \"multi-node\" or \"clustered\") environment\n, several \nlow-level methods\n have been deprecated, and some new ones have been added.\n\n\nThe following \nsails.sockets\n methods have been deprecated:\n\n\n\n\n.emit()\n\n\n.id()\n (renamed to \n.getId()\n)\n\n\n.socketRooms()\n\n\n.rooms()\n\n\n.subscribers()\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using any of those methods in your app, they will still work in v0.12 but \nyou should replace them as soon as possible\n as they may be removed from Sails in the next version.  See the individual doc pages for each method for more information.\n\n\nResourceful PubSub Methods\n#\n\n\nThe \n.subscribers()\n resourceful pubsub method has been deprecated for the same reasons as \nsails.sockets.subscribers()\n.  Follow the guidelines in the docs for replacing this method if you are using it in your code.\n\n\nWaterline (ORM) Updates\n#\n\n\nSails v0.12 comes with the latest version of the Waterline ORM (v0.11.0).  There are two API changes to be aware of:\n\n\n.save()\n no longer provides a second argument to its callback\n#\n\n\nThe callback to the \n.save()\n instance method no longer receives a second argument.  While convenient, the requirement of providing this second argument made \n.save()\n less performant, especially for apps working with millions of records.  This change resolves those issues by eliminating the need to build redundant queries, and preventing your database from having to process them.\n\n\nIf there are places in your app where you have code like this:\n\n\nsierra.save(function (err, modifiedSierra){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n\nsierra.save(function (err){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nCustom column/field names for built-in timestamps\n#\n\n\nYou can now configure a custom column name (i.e. field name for Mongo/Redis folks) for the built-in \ncreatedAt\n and \nupdatedAt\n attributes.  In the past, the top-level \nautoCreatedAt\n and \nautoUpdatedAt\n model settings could be specified as \nfalse\n to disable the automatic injection of \ncreatedAt\n and \nupdatedAt\n altogether.  That \nstill works as it always has\n, but now you can also specify string values for one or both of these settings instead.  If a string is specified, it will be understood as the custom column (/field) name to use for the automatic timestamp.\n\n\n{\n  attributes: {},\n  autoCreatedAt: 'my_cool_created_when_timestamp',\n  autoUpdatedAt: 'my_cool_updated_at_timestamp'\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you were using the \nworkaround suggested by @sgress454 here\n, you may want to take advantage of this simpler approach instead.\n\n\nSQL Adapter Performance\n#\n\n\nSails-PostgreSQL\n and \nSails-MySQL\n recieved patch updates that significantly improved performance when populating associations. Thanks to \n@jianpingw\n for digging into the source and finding a bug that was processing database records too many times. If you are using either of these adapters, upgrading to \nsails-postgresql@0.11.1\n or \nsails-mysql@0.11.3\n will give you a significant performance boost.\n\n\nContributing\n#\n\n\nWhile not technically part of the release, Sails v0.12 is accompanied by some major improvements to the tools and resources available to contributors.  More core hooks are now fully documented (\ncontrollers\n|\ngrunt\n|\nlogger\n|\ncors\n|\nresponses\n|\norm\n), and the team has put together a \nCode of Conduct\n for contributing to the Sails project.\n\n\nThe biggest change for contributors is the \nupdated contribution guide\n, which contains the new, streamlined process for feature/enhancement proposals and for merging features, enhancements, and patches into core.  As the Sails framework has grown (both the code base and the user base), it's become necessary to establish clearer processes for how issue contributions, code contributions, and contributions to the documentation are reviewed and merged.\n\n\nDocumentation\n#\n\n\nThis release also comes with a deep clean of the official reference documentation, and some minor usability improvements to the online docs at \nhttp://sailsjs.org/documentation\n. The entire Sails website is now available in \nJapanese\n, and four other \ntranslation projects\n are underway for Korean, Brazillian Portugese, Taiwanese Mandarin, and Spanish.\n\n\nIn addition, the Sails.js project (finally) has an \nofficial blog\n.  The Sails.js blog is the new source for all longform updates and announcements about Sails, as well as for our related projects like Waterline, Skipper and the machine specification.\n\n\nNeed Help?\n#\n\n\nIf you run into an unexpected issue upgrading your Sails app to v0.12.0, please review our contribution guide and \nsubmit an issue in the Sails GitHub repo\n.",

            "text": "Layouts\n#\n\n\nWhen building an app with many different pages, it can be helpful to extrapolate markup shared by several HTML files into a layout.  This \nreduces the total amount of code\n in your project and helps you avoid making the same changes in multiple files down the road.\n\n\nIn Sails and Express, layouts are implemented by the view engines themselves.  For instance, \njade\n has its own layout system, with its own syntax.\n\n\nFor convenience, Sails bundles special support for layouts \nwhen using the default view engine, EJS\n. If you'd like to use layouts with a different view engine, check out \nthat view engine's documentation\n to find the appropriate syntax.\n\n\nCreating Layouts\n#\n\n\nSails layouts are special \n.ejs\n files in your app's \nviews/\n folder you can use to \"wrap\" or \"sandwich\" other views. Layouts usually contain the preamble (e.g. \n!DOCTYPE html<html><head>....</head><body>\n) and conclusion (\n</body></html\n).  Then the original view file is included using \n<%- body %>\n.  Layouts are never used without a view- that would be like serving someone a bread sandwich.\n\n\nLayout support for your app can be configured or disabled in \nconfig/views.js\n, and can be overridden for a particular route or action by setting a special \nlocal\n called \nlayout\n. By default, Sails will compile all views using the layout located at \nviews/layout.ejs\n.\n\n\nTo specify what layout a view uses, see the example below. There is more information in the docs at \nroutes\n.\n\n\nThe example route below will use the view located at \n./views/users/privacy.ejs\n within the layout located at \n./views/users.ejs\n\n\n'get /privacy': {\n    view: 'users/privacy',\n    locals: {\n      layout: 'users'\n    }\n  },\n\n\n\n\nThe example controller action below will use the view located at \n./views/users/privacy.ejs\n within the layout located at \n./views/users.ejs\n\n\nprivacy: function (req, res) {\n  res.view('users/privacy', {layout: 'users'})\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\nWhy do layouts only work for EJS?\n#\n\n\nA couple of years ago, built-in support for layouts/partials was deprecated in Express. Instead, developers were expected to rely on the view engines themselves to implement this features. (See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/494 for more info on that.)\n\n\nSails supports the legacy \nlayouts\n feature for convenience, backwards compatibility with Express 2.x and Sails 0.8.x apps, and in particular, familiarity for new community members coming from other MVC frameworks. As a result, layouts have only been tested with the default view engine (ejs).\n\n\nIf layouts aren\u2019t your thing, or (for now) if you\u2019re using a server-side view engine other than ejs, (e.g. Jade, handlebars, haml, dust) you\u2019ll want to set \nlayout:false\n in \nsails.config.views\n, then rely on your view engine\u2019s custom layout/partial support.",

Layouts are never used without a view- that would be like serving someone a bread sandwich.  Layout support for your app can be configured or disabled in  config/views.js , and can be overridden for a particular route or action by setting a special  local  called  layout . By default, Sails will compile all views using the layout located at  views/layout.ejs .  To specify what layout a view uses, see the example below. There is more information in the docs at  routes .  The example route below will use the view located at  ./views/users/privacy.ejs  within the layout located at  ./views/users.ejs  'get /privacy': {\n    view: 'users/privacy',\n    locals: {\n      layout: 'users'\n    }\n  },  The example controller action below will use the view located at  ./views/users/privacy.ejs  within the layout located at  ./views/users.ejs  privacy: function (req, res) {\n  res.view('users/privacy', {layout: 'users'})\n}",

Sails supports the legacy  layouts  feature for convenience, backwards compatibility with Express 2.x and Sails 0.8.x apps, and in particular, familiarity for new community members coming from other MVC frameworks. As a result, layouts have only been tested with the default view engine (ejs).

For example, imagine your app has duplicate copies of the following code in a few different views:\n\n\n<%\n// A list representing the currently-logged in user's inbox.\n%><ul class=\"message-list\"><%\n  // Display each message, with a button to delete it.\n  _.each(messages, function (message) {\n  %><li class=\"inbox-message\" data-id=\"<%= message.id %>\">\n    <a href=\"/messages/<%= message.id %>\"><%= message.subject %></a>\n    <button class=\"fa fa-trash\" is=\"delete-btn\"></button>\n  </li><% });\n %></ul>\n\n\n\n\nTo refactor this, you might extrapolate the \n<li>\n into a partial to avoid duplicating code.

In most cases, views are used as the response to an incoming HTTP request, e.g. to serve your home page.\n\n\nAlternatively, a view can be compiled directly into an HTML string for use in your backend code (see \nsails.renderView()\n.)  For instance, you might use this approach to send HTML emails, or to build big XML strings for use with a legacy API.\n\n\nCreating a view\n#\n\n\nBy default, Sails is configured to use EJS (\nEmbedded Javascript\n) as its view engine.

Custom adapters can be built directly in your app (\napi/adapters/\n) or published as NPM packages.  Check out \nIntro to Custom Adapters\n, the \nAdapter Interface Reference\n, and \nsails-adapter-boilerplate\n for more information about creating your own adapter.\n\n\nWhat goes in a custom adapter?\n#\n\n\nIn Sails, database adapters expose \ninterfaces\n, which imply a conract to implemnt certain functionality.  This allows us to guarantee conventional usage patterns across multiple models, developers, apps, and even companies, making app code more maintainable, efficient, and reliable.  Adapters are primarily useful for integrating with databases, but they can also be used to support any open API or internal/proprietary web service that is \npurely\n RESTful.\n\n\n\n\nNot everything fits perfectly into a RESTful/CRUD mold.  Sometimes the service you're integrating with has more of an RPC-style interface, with one-off methods.  For example, consider an API request to send an email, or to read a remote sensor on a piece of connected hardware.  For that, you'll want to write or extend a machinepack.  \nLearn more about machinepacks here\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of things can I do in an adapter?\n#\n\n\nAdapters are mainly focused on providing model-contextualized CRUD methods.  CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete.  In Sails/Waterline, we call these methods \ncreate()\n, \nfind()\n, \nupdate()\n, and \ndestroy()\n.\n\n\nFor example, a \nMySQLAdapter\n implements a \ncreate()\n method which, internally, calls out to a MySQL database using the specified table name and connection informtion and runs an \nINSERT ...\n SQL query.\n\n\nIn practice, your adapter can really do anything it likes-- any method you write will be exposed on the raw datastore objects and any models which use them.\n\n\nBuilding a custom adapter\n#\n\n\nCheck out the \nSails docs\n, or see \nconfig/datastores.js\n in a new Sails project for information on setting up this adapter in a Sails app.\n\n\nRunning the tests\n#\n\n\nConfigure the interfaces you plan to support (and targeted version of Sails/Waterline) in the adapter's \npackage.json\n file:\n\n\n{\n  //...\n  \"sails\": {\n    \"adapter\": {\n        \"sailsVersion\": \"~0.10.0\",\n        \"implements\": [\n          \"semantic\",\n          \"queryable\"\n        ]\n      }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn your adapter's directory, run:\n\n\n$ npm test\n\n\n\n\nPublish your adapter\n#\n\n\n\n\nYou're welcome to write proprietary adapters and use them any way you wish--\nthese instructions are for releasing an open-source adapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nnew public repo\n and add it as a remote (`git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/sails-youradaptername.git)\n\n\nMake sure you attribute yourself as the author and set the license in the package.json to \"MIT\".\n\n\nRun the tests one last time.\n\n\nDo a \npull request to sails-docs\n adding your adapter's repo.\n\n\nWe'll update the documentation with information about your new adapter\n\n\nLet the people of world adore you with lavish praises.\n\n\nRun \nnpm version patch\n\n\nRun \ngit push && git push --tags\n\n\nRun \nnpm publish\n\n\n\n\nWhy would I need a custom adapter?\n#\n\n\nWhen building a Sails app, the sending or receiving of any asynchronous communication with another piece of hardware can \ntechnically\n be normalized into an adapter.  (viz. API integrations)\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\n\n\nAlthough a relational database provides a common persistence layer in software applications, numerous other persistence layers exist. CRUD functionality can be implemented with an object database, an XML database, flat text files, custom file formats, tape, or card, for example.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Waterline is not \nnecessarily\n just an ORM for your database.  It is a purpose-agnostic, open standard and toolset for integrating with all kinds of RESTful services, datasources, and devices, whether it's LDAP, Neo4J, or \na lamp\n.\n\n\n\n\nBut remember:\n only use Waterline adapters for communicating with databases and APIs that support a \"create\", \"read\", \"update\", and \"destroy\" interface.  Not everything fits into that mold, and there are \nbetter, more generic ways\n to address those other use cases.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I build a custom adapter?\n#\n\n\nTo recap, writing your API integrations as adapters is \neasier\n, takes \nless time\n, and \nabsorbs a considerable amount of risk\n, since you get the advantage of a \nstandardized set of conventions\n, a \ndocumented API\n, and a \nbuilt-in community\n of other developers who have gone through the same process.  Best of all, you (and your team) can \nreuse the adapter\n in other projects, \nspeeding up development\n and \nsaving time and money\n.\n\n\nFinally, if you choose to release your adapter as open-source, you provide a tremendous boon to our little framework and our budding Sails.js ecosystem.  Even if it's not via Sails, I encourage you to give back to the OSS community, even if you've never forked a repo before-- don't be intimidated, it's not that bad!\n\n\nThe more high-quality adapters the Sails community collectively releases as open-source, the less repetitive work we all have to do when we integrate with various databases and services.  Our vision is to make building server-side apps more fun and less repetitive for everyone, and that happens one community adapter (or machinepack/driver/generator/view engine/etc.) at a time.\n\n\nWhat is an adapter interface?\n#\n\n\nThe functionality of database adapters is as varied as the services they connect.  That said, there is a standard library of methods, and a support matrix you should be aware of.  Adapters may implement some, all, or none of the interfaces below, but rest assured that \nif an adapter implements one method in an interface, it should implement \nall\n of them\n.  This is not always the case due to limitations and/or incomplete implementations, but at the very least, a descriptive error message should be used to keep developers informed of what's supported and what's not.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, check out the Sails docs, and specifically the \nadapter interface reference\n.\n\n\n\n\nAre there examples I can look at?\n#\n\n\nIf you're looking for some inspiration, a good place to start is with the core adapters.  Take a look at \nMySQL\n, \nPostgreSQL\n, \nMongoDB\n, \nRedis\n, local \ndisk\n, or local \nmemory\n.\n\n\nWhere do I get help?\n#\n\n\nAn active community of Sails and Waterline users exists on GitHub, Stack Overflow, Google groups, IRC, Gitter, and more.

In fact, Sails core uses \ngenerators\n to create Sails projects.  So when you type...\n\n\n~/ $ sails new myProject\n\n\n\n\n...sails is using \ngenerators\n to build up the initial folder structure of a Sails app like this:\n\n\nmyProject\n       |_api\n       |_assets\n       |_config\n       |_node_modules\n       |_tasks\n       |_views                \n.gitignore\n.sailsrc\napp.js\nGruntfile.js\npackage.json\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nOther examples of \ngenerators\n in Sails core (meaning they are built into Sails) include:\n\n\n\n\nsails-generate-adapter\n\n\nsails-generate-backend\n\n\nsails-generate-controller\n\n\nsails-generate-frontend\n\n\nsails-generate-model\n\n\nsails-generate-new\n\n\nsails-generate-views\n\n\nsails-generate-views-jade\n\n\nAlthough not a stand-alone module there's one other \ngenerator\n accessed via \nsails generate api\n\n\n\n\nTo begin the process of generating a generator you can use \nsails-generate-generator\n. \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The idea of creating a \ngenerator\n by invoking a \ngenerator\n may seem like some kind of demented infinite loop but trust us it will not create a worm hole to an evil alternate universe. \n\n\n\n\nCreating a Generator\n#\n\n\nFirst we need a Sails project.  If you haven't already created one go to your terminal and type:\n\n\n~/ $ sails new myProject\n\n\n\n\ncd\n into \nmyProject\n or from any existing Sails project and create a \ngenerator\n from the terminal named \nawesome\n by typing:\n\n\n~/ $ sails generate generator awesome \n\n\n\n\nYou'll know the generator was created if you see the message: \ninfo: Created a new generator!\n.\n\n\nEnabling the Generator\n#\n\n\nTo enable the \ngenerator\n you need to tell Sails about it via \n\\myProject\\.sailsrc\n. If you were using an existing generator you would link to an npm module in \n.sailsrc\n and then just install it with \nnpm install\n.  Since you're developing a generator, you'll link to it directly.  To create the link go back to the terminal and \ncd\n into the \nawesome\n \ngenerator\n folder and type:\n\n\n~/ $  pwd\n\n\n\n\nThe \npwd\n command will return a fully resolved path to the \ngenerator\n (e.g. \n/Users/irl/sails_projects/myProject/awesome\n).\n\n\nCopy the path and then open \nmyProject/.sailsrc\n.  Within the \nmodules\n property add an \nawesome\n key and paste the path to the \nawesome\n \ngenerator\n as the value. \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n you can name the \ngenerator\n anything you want, for now let's stick with \nawesome\n:\n\n\n\n\n{\n  \"generators\": {\n    \"modules\": {\n        \"awesome\": \"/Users/irl/sails_projects/myProject/awesome\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Whatever name you give your \ngenerator\n in the \n.sailsrc\n file will be the name you'll use from the terminal command-line to execute it.\n\n\n\n\nLastly, you'll need to do an \nnpm install\n from the terminal in order to install the necessary modules that were added to the generator's \npackage.json\n file.\n\n\nUsing the Generator\n#\n\n\nBack at the terminal type: \nsails generate awesome example\n. Let's take a look at what was generated.\n\n\nWhat did the Generator create?\n#\n\n\nOpen up your project in a text editor you'll notice that a folder called \nhey_look_a_folder\n was created and a file named \nexample\n was also created: \n\n\n/**\n * This is just an example file created at Wed Jun 04 2014 17:35:59 GMT-0500 (CDT).\n *\n * You can use underscore templates, see?\n */\n\nmodule.exports = function () {\n  // ...\n};\n\n\n\n\nThe folder and file illustrate the power of the \ngenerator\n not only to create elements but to use \narguments\n from the command-line to influence their content. For example, the file name, \nexample\n, used an element from the command line argument \nsails generate awesome example\n.\n\n\nBasic generator configuration\n#\n\n\nAll of the configuration for the \nawesome\n \ngenerator\n is contained in \n\\myProjects\\awesome\\Generator.js\n.  The main parts of \nGenerator.js\n are the \nbefore()\n function and the \ntargets\n dictionary.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n We refer to the JavaScript object that uses \n{}\n as a dictionary.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the \nbefore()\n function\n#\n\n\nLet's take a closer look at \nmyProject/awesome/Generator.js\n:\n\n\n...\nbefore: function (scope, cb) {\n\n    // scope.args are the raw command line arguments.\n    if (!scope.args[0]) {\n      return cb( new Error('Please provide a name for this awesome.') );\n    }\n\n    // scope.rootPath is the base path for this generator\n    if (!scope.rootPath) {\n      return cb( INVALID_SCOPE_VARIABLE('rootPath') );\n    }\n\n    // Attach defaults\n    _.defaults(scope, {\n      createdAt: new Date()\n    });\n\n    // Decide the output filename for use in targets below:\n    scope.filename = scope.args[0];\n\n    // Add other stuff to the scope for use in our templates:\n    scope.whatIsThis = 'an example file created at '+scope.createdAt;\n\n    // When finished, we trigger a callback with no error\n    // to begin generating files/folders as specified by\n    // the `targets` below.\n    cb();\n  },\n  ...\n  ```\n\nEach _generator_ has access to the `scope` dictionary, which is useful when you want to obtain the arguments that were entered when the _generator_ was executed.\n\nIn your default `awesome` _generator_ a new key, `createdAt:` was created in the scope.  We'll take a look at this dictionary within a template momentarily.\n\n```javascript\n...\n// Attach defaults\n    _.defaults(scope, {\n      createdAt: new Date()\n    });\n...\n\n\n\n\nNext, the arguments used when executing the awesome \ngenerator\n (e.g. \nsails generate awesome <theargument>\n) are available in an array from \nscope.args\n.  In our default \nawesome\n \ngenerator\n a \nfilename\n property was added to the scope and assigned the value of the first element of the \nscope.args\n array (e.g. example):\n\n\n...\nscope.filename = scope.args[0];\n...\n\n\n\n\nFinally, another property (e.g. scope.whatIsThis) was added to the scope dictionary.\n\n\n...\nscope.whatIsThis = 'an example file created at '+scope.createdAt;\n...\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the targets dictionary\n#\n\n\nNow, let's take a look at the \ntargets\n dictionary in \nmyProject\\awesome\\Generator.js\n to better understand how the folder (e.g. hey_look_a_folder) and file (e.g. example) were generated. \n\n\n...\ntargets: {\n\n    // Usage:\n    // './path/to/destination.foo': { someHelper: opts }\n\n    // Creates a dynamically-named file relative to `scope.rootPath`\n    // (defined by the `filename` scope variable).\n    //\n    // The `template` helper reads the specified template, making the\n    // entire scope available to it (uses underscore/JST/ejs syntax).\n    // Then the file is copied into the specified destination (on the left).\n    './:filename': { template: 'example.template.js' },\n\n    // Creates a folder at a static path\n    './hey_look_a_folder': { folder: {} }\n\n  },\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntemplate\n and \nfolder\n helpers look a lot like routes.  These helpers perform the actions that their names indicate.\n\n\nThe \ntemplate\n helper\n#\n\n\nNot surprisingly the \ntemplate\n helper creates files based upon a template.  Remember, that the scope dictionary is accessible to the templates.\n\n\n...\n'./:filename': { template: 'example.template.js' },\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe left-hand side specifies the path and filename where as the right dictates which template the \ngenerator\n will use to create the file.  Notice you're using the \nfilename\n from the \nscope.filename\n assignment that was based upon the the first element of \nscope.args\n in the \nbefore()\n function.  The templates can be found in \nmyProject\\awesome\\templates\n.  In the awesome \ngenerator\n you're using \nexample.template.js\n:\n\n\n/**\n * This is just <%= whatIsThis %>.\n *\n * You can use underscore templates, see?\n */\n\nmodule.exports = function () {\n  // ...\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n the scope property \nwhatIsThis\n which as you may recall uses the createdAt: property created in the \nbefore\n function.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfolder\n helper\n#\n\n\nThe \nfolder\n helper generates folders.  \n\n\n...\n'./hey_look_a_folder': { folder: {} }\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe left-hand side specifies the path and name of the folder.  The right-hand side specifies any optional parameters. For example, by default, if a folder already exists at that location an error will be displayed:\n\nSomething else already exists at ::<path of folder>\n.  If you want the \ngenerator\n to overwrite an existing folder you have two options.  You can alter the \nfolder\n helper to overwrite the existing folder by specifying \nforce: true\n in the options parameters:\n\n\n...\n'./hey_look_a_folder': { folder: { force: true} }\n...\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the \n--force\n parameter from the command-line when executing the \ngenerator\n which will configure all helpers to overwrite:\n\n\n~/ $ sails generate awesome test --force\n\n\n\n\nUsing a generator within a generator\n#\n\n\nTo leverage the work of other programmers, \ngenerators\n were designed to be used by other \ngenerators\n.  This is where the scope dictionary being passed down to all \ngenerators\n becomes really powerful. \n\n\nFor example, Sails core has a \ngenerator\n called \nsails-generate-model\n.  Since it's built into Sails core, there's no installation necessary.  To add it to our awesome \ngenerator\n example is simple.  Within the \nmyProject\\awesome\\Generator.js\n include it by inserting \n./': ['model'],\n\n\n...\ntargets: {\n\n    // './:filename': { template: 'example.template.js' },\n\n    './': ['model'],\n\n    // './hey_look_a_folder': { folder: {} }\n\n  },\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n By using \n./\n as the path, any models will be placed in the \n\\api\\models\n folder from whatever folder the generator was executed.\n\n\n\n\nThat's it!  Now let's create a model from within the awesome \ngenerator\n.  From the terminal type:\n\n\n~/ $ sails generate awesome user name:string email:email\n\n\n\n\nIf you take a look in \nmyProject\\api\\models\n you'll see a new file named \nUser.js\n has been created that contains the model attributes specified earlier.\n\n\n/**\n* User\n*\n* @description :: TODO: You might write a short summary of how this model works and what it represents here.\n* @docs        :: http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/models\n*/\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  attributes: {\n\n    name : { type: 'string' },\n\n    email : { type: 'email' }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Publishing your generator to npmjs.org\n#\n\n\nTo publish the awesome \ngenerator\n to npmjs.org go into the \nmyProject\\awesome\\package.json\n file and change the name, author and any other meta information (e.g. licensing).\n\n\nFrom within the \nmyProject\\awesome\n folder at the terminal type:\n\n\n~/ $ npm publish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n  If you don't already have an NPM account, go to \nnpmjs.org\n and create one.\n\n\n\n\nTo unpublish the module, type: \n\n\n~/ $  npm unpublish --force\n\n\n\n\nChange the \nmyProject\\.sailsrc\n to:\n\n\n{\n  \"generators\": {\n    \"modules\": {\n      \"awesome\": \"whatever you named the module in package.json\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFrom the awesome \ngenerator\n folder within the terminal type:\n\n\n~/ $ npm install\n\n\n\n\nAnd you're all set!",

The \nhook specification\n defines the requirements a module must meet for Sails to be able to import its code and make the new functionality available.

Then \ncreate the project hook\n or copy the folder for the hook you want to use into \napi/hooks\n.\n\n\nUsing an installable hook\n#\n\n\nTo use an installable hook in your app, simply run \nnpm install\n with the package name of the hook you wish to install (e.g. \nnpm install sails-hook-autoreload\n).  You may also manually copy or link an \ninstallable hook folder that you've created\n directly into your app\u2019s \nnode_modules\n folder.\n\n\nCalling hook methods\n#\n\n\nAny methods that a hook exposes are available in the \nsails.hooks[<hook-name>]\n object.  For example, the \nsails-hook-email\n hook provides a \nsails.hooks.email.send()\n method (note that the \nsails-hook-\n prefix is stripped off).  Consult a hook\u2019s documentation to determine which methods it provides.\n\n\nConfiguring a hook\n#\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve added an installable hook to your app, you can configure it using the regular Sails config files like \nconfig/local.js\n, \nconfig/env/development.js\n, or a custom config file you create yourself.  Hook settings are typically namespaced under the hook\u2019s name, with any \nsails-hook-\n prefix stripped off.  For example, the \nfrom\n setting for \nsails-hook-email\n is available as \nsails.config.email.from\n.  The documentation for the installable hook should describe the available configuration options.\n\n\nChanging the way Sails loads an installable hook\n#\n\n\nOn rare occassions, you may need to change the name that Sails uses for an installable hook, or change the configuration key that the hook uses.  This may be the case if you already have a project hook with the same name as an installable hook, or if you\u2019re already using a configuration key for something else.

            "text": "Introduction to Custom Adapters for Sails / Waterline\n#\n\n\n\n\nStability: Varies\n#\n\n\n\n\nReference\n#\n\n\nPlease see the \nadapter interface specification\n.\n\n\nWhat is an adapter?\n#\n\n\nAdapters expose \ninterfaces\n, which imply a conract to implemnt certain functionality.  This allows us to guarantee conventional usage patterns across multiple models, developers, apps, and even companies, making app code more maintainable, efficient, and reliable.  Adapters are useful for integrating with databases, open APIs, internal/proprietary web services, or even hardware.\n\n\nWhat kind of things can I do in an adapter?\n#\n\n\nAdapters are mainly focused on providing model-contextualized CRUD methods.  CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete.  In Sails/Waterline, we call these methods \ncreate()\n, \nfind()\n, \nupdate()\n, and \ndestroy()\n.\n\n\nFor example, a \nMySQLAdapter\n implements a \ncreate()\n method which, internally, calls out to a MySQL database using the specified table name and connection information and runs an \nINSERT ...\n SQL query.\n\n\nIn practice, your adapter can really do anything it likes-- any method you write will be exposed on the raw connection objects and any models which use them.\n\n\nWhy would I need a custom adapter?\n#\n\n\nWhen building a Sails app, the sending or receiving of any asynchronous communication with another piece of hardware can be normalized into an adapter.  (viz. API integrations) \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\n\n\nAlthough a relational database provides a common persistence layer in software applications, numerous other persistence layers exist. CRUD functionality can be implemented with an object database, an XML database, flat text files, custom file formats, tape, or card, for example.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Waterline is not just an ORM for your database.  It is a purpose-agnostic, open standard and toolset for integrating with all kinds of RESTful services, datasources, and devices, whether it's LDAP, Neo4J, or \na lamp\n.\nI know, I know... Not everything fits perfectly into a RESTful/CRUD mold!  Sometimes the service you're integrating with has more of an RPC-style interface, with one-off method names.  That's ok-- you can define any adapter methods you like! You still get all of the trickle-down config and connection-management goodness of Waterline core.\n\n\nWhy should I build a custom adapter?\n#\n\n\nTo recap, writing your API integrations as adapters is \neasier\n, takes \nless time\n, and \nabsorbs a considerable amount of risk\n, since you get the advantage of a \nstandardized set of conventions\n, a \ndocumented API\n, and a \nbuilt-in community\n of other developers who have gone through the same process.  Best of all, you (and your team) can \nreuse the adapter\n in other projects, \nspeeding up development\n and \nsaving time and money\n.\n\n\nFinally, if you choose to release your adapter as open-source, you provide a tremendous boon to our little framework and our budding Sails.js ecosystem.  Even if it's not via Sails, I encourage you to give back to the OSS community, even if you've never forked a repo before-- don't be intimidated, it's not that bad!\n\n\nThe more high-quality adapters we collectively release as open-source, the less repetitive work we all have to do when we integrate with various databases and services.  My vision is to make building server-side apps more fun and less repetitive for everyone, and that happens one community adapter at a time.\n\n\nI tip my hat to you in advance :)\n\n\nWhat is an Adapter Interface?\n#\n\n\nThe functionality of adapters is as varied as the services they connect.  That said, there is a standard library of methods, and a support matrix you should be aware of.  Adapters may implement some, all, or none of the interfaces below, but rest assured that \nif an adapter implements one method in an interface, it should implement \nall\n of them\n.  This is not always the case due to limitations and/or incomplete implementations, but at the very least, a descriptive error message should be used to keep developers informed of what's supported and what's not.\n\n\nClass methods\n#\n\n\nBelow, \nclass methods\n refer to the static, or collection-oriented, functions available on the model itself, e.g. \nUser.create()\n or \nMenu.update()\n.  To add custom class methods to your model (beyond what is provided in the adapters it implements), define them as top-level key/function pairs in the model object.\n\n\nInstance methods\n#\n\n\ninstance methods\n on the other hand, (also known as object, or model, methods) refer to methods available on the individual result models themselves, e.g. \nUser.findOne(7).done(function (err, user) { user.someInstanceMethod(); });\n.  To add custom instance methods to your model (beyond what is provided in the adapters it implements), define them as key/function pairs in the \nattributes\n object of the model's definition.\n\n\nDDL and auto-migrations\n#\n\n\nDDL\n stands for data-definition language, and is a common fixture of schema-oriented databases.  In Sails, auto-migrations are supported out of the box.  Since adapters for the most common SQL databases support \nalter()\n, they also support automatic schema migration!  In your own adapter, if you write the \nalter()\n method, the same behavior will take effect.  The feature is configurable using the \nmigrate\n property, which can be set to \nsafe\n (don't touch the schema, period), \ndrop\n (recreate the tables every time the app starts), or \nalter\n (the default-- merge the schema in the apps' models with what is currently in the database).\n\n\nOffcially supported adapters\n#\n\n\nCody, Mike, and the team behind Sails.js at Balderdash support a handful of commonly used adapters.\n\n\nDisk\n#\n\n\nWrite to your computer's hard disk, or a mounted network drive.  Not suitable for at-scale production deployments, but great for a small project, and essential for developing in environments where you may not always have a database set up.

            "text": "What is Sails?\n#\n\n\nSails is, of course, a web framework.  But take a step back.  What does that mean?  Sometimes, when we refer to the \"web\", we mean the \"front-end web.\"  We think of concepts like web standards, or HTML 5, or CSS 3; and frameworks like Backbone, or Angular, or jQuery.  Sails is not \"that kind\" of a web framework.  Sails works great with Angular and Backbone, but you would never use Sails \ninstead\n of those libraries.\n\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes when we talk about \"web frameworks\", we mean the \"back-end web.\"  This evokes concepts like REST, or HTTP, or WebSockets; and technologies like Java, or Ruby, or Node.js.  A \"back-end web\" framework helps you do things like build APIs, serve HTML files, and handle hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users.  Sails is \"that kind\" of web framework.\n\n\nConvention over Configuration\n#\n\n\nSails accomplishes many of the same goals as other MVC web application frameworks, using many of the same methodologies.  This was done on purpose.  A consistent approach makes developing apps more predictable and efficient for everybody involved.\n\n\nImagine starting a new job at a company building a Sails app (or imagine starting the company, if that's your thing.)  If anyone on your team has worked with frameworks like Zend, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Cake, Grails, Django, ASP.NET MVC, or Rails, Sails will feel pretty familiar.  Not only that, but they can look at a Sails project and know, generally, how to code up the basic patterns they've implemented over and over again in the past; whether their background is in PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, or Node.js.  What about your second app, or your third?  Each time you create a new Sails app, you start with a sane, familiar boilerplate that makes you more productive.  In many cases, you'll even be able to recycle some of your backend code.\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSails didn't invent this concept-- it's \nbeen around for years\n.  Even before the phrase \"Convention over Configuration\" (or CoC) was popularized by Ruby on Rails, it was a core tenet of the JavaBeans specification and in many ways, a natural lashback against the extremely verbose XML configuration common in traditional Java web frameworks of the late '90s and early 2000s.\n\n\n\n\nLoose Coupling\n#\n\n\nThe days of forcing a one-size-fits-all approach to development are over.  We need tools that allow us to pick and choose the components that fit our requirements.  In fact, it\u2019s just plain lazy to create things any other way.  Sails\u2019s approach is to loosely couple components so that they can be added or subtracted from your app at will.\n\n\nNode at its core has created a \u201ccan do\u201d culture eager to experiment and make things work. Sails embraces this attitude and strives to deliver tools that work around you.  The level of automation or magic you want in Sails is directly tied to the time you have for a project and your experience working with Node. Sails is flexible enough to allow you to explore and create when you have the time but also provides automation when you don\u2019t.\n\n\nSails accomplishes this loose coupling using plain-old require.  No magic, other than the time to craft components that can be part of the whole but don\u2019t need to be present in order for the whole to work.  For example, controllers, models, and configuration files are just Node modules.  Sails uses some convention to help.  Sails picks up on the name UserController.js in the Controllers folder to deduce that this is indeed a user controller.  Another example involves policies.  So policies allow you to have a bit of code that executes on controller or specific controller action.  The cool part is that the configuration file that connects the policy with the controller/action are separate.  That means you can write a bunch of different policies and they are completely portable between Sails apps.  You can decide later which controller/actions you want to apply them to.  \n\n\nSails core consists of twenty different hooks: modules that modify the server runtime, adding middleware, binding route listeners, or otherwise attaching additional capabilities to the framework.  This gives you access to override or disable every component and configuration parameter in Sails.  These hooks are loaded at run-time when Sails starts.  You even have the ability to have one-time configuration for your hook itself.  This is actually one of the key differentiators between hooks and services.\n\n\nAnother example of loose coupling is configuration files.  Need some configuration to be available for your project?  No problem.  Create a file in the config folder that uses the common module.exports pattern and everything in that module is available for you from the sails global object.\n\n\nAlmost every component of Sails can either be omitted, overwritten, or extended.  For example, Sails has a group of tools called blueprints.  These blueprints make it really easy to get a project up and running with regard to routes and CRUD operations.  But suppose you want to use the read, update, and delete operations but the create action needs some tender loving care.  No problem, just build a create action and the other CRUD operations keep working.  Your custom action subs in for the blueprint action.  It\u2019s just that simple.\n\n\n\n\nLinks:\n+ \nUnix philosophy\n\n+ \nNode culture",

Here are a few of its most useful properties:\n\n\nsails.models\n#\n\n\nA dictionary of all loaded \nSails models\n, indexed by their \nidentity\n.\n\n\nBy default, a model's identity is the lowercased version of its filename, without the \n.js\n extension.  For example, the default identity for a model loaded from \napi/models/PowerPuff.js\n would be \npowerpuff\n, and the model would be accessible via \nsails.models.powerpuff\n.  A model's identity can be customized by setting an \nidentity\n property in its module file.\n\n\nsails.config\n#\n\n\nThe full set of configuration options for the Sails instance, loaded from a combination of environment variables, \n.sailsrc\n files, user-configuration files and defaults.  See the \nconfiguration concepts section\n for a full overview of configuring Sails, and the \nconfiguration reference\n for details on individual options.\n\n\nsails.sockets\n#\n\n\nA set of convenience methods for low-level interaction with connected websockets.  See the \nsails.sockets.*\n reference section\n for details.\n\n\nsails.hooks\n#\n\n\nA dictionary of all loaded \nSails hooks\n, indexed by their \nidentity\n.  Use \nsails.hooks\n to access properties and methods of hooks you've installed to extend Sails; for example, by calling \nsails.hooks.email.send()\n.  You can also use this dictionary to access the Sails \ncore hooks\n, for advanced usage.\n\n\nBy default, a hook's identity is the lowercased version of its folder name, with any \nsails-hook-\n prefix removed.  For example, the default identity for a hook loaded from \nnode_modules/sails-hook-email\n would be \nemail\n, and the hook would be accessible via \nsails.hooks.email\n.  An installed hook's identity can be changed via the \ninstalledHooks\n config property\n.\n\n\nSee the \nhooks concept documentation\n for more info about hooks.\n\n\nsails.io\n#\n\n\nThe API exposed by the \nsails.sockets.*\n methods\n is flexible enough out of the box to cover the requirements of most applications, and using them will future-proof your app against possible changes in the underlying implementation.  However, if you are working on bringing some legacy code from a vanilla Socket.io app into your Sails app, it can be useful to talk to Socket.io directly.  To accomplish this, Sails provides raw access to the underlying \nsocket.io\n server instance (\nio\n) as \nsails.io\n. See the \nSocket.io docs\n for more information.  If you decide to use Socket.io directly, please proceed with care.\n\n\n\n\nAs of v0.11.4, Sails bundles \nsocket.io@v1.4.3\n as a dependency of \nsails-hook-sockets\n, a core hook.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new application object (advanced)\n#\n\n\nIf you are implementing something unconventional (e.g. writing tests for Sails core)\nwhere you need to create more than one Sails application instance in a process, you \nshould not\n use\nthe instance returned by \nrequire('sails')\n, as this can cause unexpected behavior.  Instead, you should\nobtain application instances by using the Sails constructor:\n\n\nvar Sails = require('sails').constructor;\nvar sails0 = new Sails();\nvar sails1 = new Sails();\nvar sails2 = new Sails();\n\n\n\n\nEach app instance (\nsails0\n, \nsails1\n, \nsails2\n) can be loaded/lifted separately,\nusing different configuration.\n\n\nFor more on using Sails programatically, see the conceptual overview on \nprogramatic usage in Sails\n.",

See the \nBlueprint Routes documentation section\n for a discussion of the different blueprint types.\n\n\nRESTful routes\n#\n\n\nRESTful routes are activated by default in new Sails apps, and can be turned off by setting \nsails.config.blueprints.rest\n to \nfalse\n (typically in \n/config/blueprints.js\n.\n\n\nSails will create RESTful routes whenever it loads a \ncontroller\n and \nmodel\n file with the same identity.  For example, \napi/controllers/PetController.js\n and \napi/models/Pet.js\n would both have the identity \npet\n.  If both of those files were added to a Sails app (manually or by running \nsails generate api pet\n), then Sails would automatically create RESTful routes accessible at the URL \n/pet\n whenever the app was loaded.\n\n\nShortcut routes\n#\n\n\nShortcut routes are activated by default in new Sails apps, and can be turned off by setting \nsails.config.blueprints.shortcuts\n to \nfalse\n (typically in \n/config/blueprints.js\n.\n\n\nLike RESTful routes (see above), Sails creates shortcut routes for any controller/model pair with the same identity.  Note that the same \naction\n is executed for similar RESTful/shortcut routes.  For example, the \nPOST /user\n and \nGET /user/create\n routes that Sails creates when it loads \napi/controllers/UserController.js\n and \napi/models/User.js\n will respond by running the same code (even if you \noverride the blueprint action\n)\n\n\nAction routes\n#\n\n\nActions routes are activated by default in new Sails apps, and can be turned off by setting \nsails.config.blueprints.actions\n to \nfalse\n (typically in \n/config/blueprints.js\n.\n\n\nWhile action routes are activated, any function added as a property of a controller's \nmodule.exports\n object will be exposed as a route at the URL \n<controller identity>/<property name>\n.  For example, if \napi/controllers/PetController.js\n contains:\n\n\nmodule.exports {\n  adore: function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"I adore pets!\");\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nthen a route \n/pet/adore\n will automatically be created.  Note that action routes respond to \nall\n HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, etc.).  You can use \nreq.method\n inside an action to determine which method was used.\n\n\nDisabling blueprints on a per-controller basis\n#\n\n\nYou may also override any of the settings from \nconfig/blueprints.js\n on a per-controller basis by defining a \n_config\n key in your controller definition:\n\n\n// In /api/controllers/PetController.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  _config: {\n    actions: false,\n    shortcuts: false,\n    rest: false\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOverriding blueprints\n#\n\n\nRESTful / shortcut routes and actions\n#\n\n\nTo override a RESTful blueprint route for a single controller, simply create an action in that controller with the appropriate name: \nfind\n, \nfindOne\n, \ncreate\n, \nupdate\n, \ndestroy\n, \npopulate\n, \nadd\n or \nremove\n.\n\n\nTo override the default \naction\n that \nall\n controllers use, create an \napi/blueprints\n folder and add files to it with names matching the actions to override (e.g. \nfind.js\n, \nfindone.js\n, \ncreate.js\n, etc.). You can take a look at \nthe code for the default actions\n in the Sails blueprints hook for a head start.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n All blueprint action files must be lowercase! (The default actions contains \nfindOne.js\n, but in \n/api/blueprints\n it needs to be \nfindone.js\n).\n\n\n\n\nAction routes\n#\n\n\nIn production apps, you may often wish to turn action routes off completely for security reasons (to keep from accidentally exposing a controller action).  However, if you do wish to keep action routes on, but simply want to turn off a particular method or path, you can do so easily in your \n/config/routes.js\n file using the \nresponse target syntax\n, for example:\n\n\n'POST /user': {response: 'notFound'}\n\n\n\n\nCustom blueprints\n#\n\n\nAlong with the built-in RESTful actions provided by Sails, you can create your own custom blueprints to be shared by your controllers.  However, custom blueprints do not get bound to routes automatically. If you create a /blueprints/foo.js file, you can bind a route to it in your \n/config/routes.js\n file using the \nblueprint target syntax\n.  For example:\n\n\nGET /myRoute: {blueprint: 'foo'}\n\n\n\n\nBlueprints and resourceful pubsub\n#\n\n\nBlueprints and \n.subscribe()\n#\n\n\nBy default, the \nFind\n and \nFind One\n blueprint actions will call \n.subscribe()\n automatically when a socket request is used. This subscribes the requesting socket to each of the returned records.  However, the \nUpdate\n and \nDestroy\n actions will \nnot\n cause a message to be sent to the requesting socket by default--only to the \nother\n connected sockets.  This is intended to allow the caller of \nio.socket.update()\n (for example) to use the client-side SDK's callback to handle the server response separately.  To force the blueprint actions to send messages to all sockets, \nincluding the requesting socket\n, set \nsails.config.blueprints.mirror\n to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nBlueprints and \n.watch()\n#\n\n\nBy default, the \nFind\n blueprint action will call \n.watch()\n on the model.  This behavior can be changed for all models by setting \nsails.config.blueprints.autoWatch\n to \nfalse\n, or for a specific model by setting the \nautoWatch\n property to \nfalse\n in the model's definition (e.g. in \napi/models/Foo.js\n).\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the following documentation focuses on HTTP, the blueprint API (just like any of your custom actions and policies) is also compatible with WebSockets, thanks to the virtual request interpreter.  Check out the reference section on the browser SDK (\nReference > WebSockets > sails.io.js\n) for example usage.",

            "text": "Miscellaneous (\nsails.config.*\n)\n#\n\n\nFor a conceptual overview of configuration in Sails, see http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/Configuration.\n\n\nThis page is a quick reference of assorted configuration topics that don't fit elsewhere, namely top-level properties on the sails.config object.  Many of these properties are best set on a \nper-environment basis\n, or in your \nconfig/local.js\n.  To set them globally for your app, create a new file in the \nconfig\n folder (e.g. \nconfig/misc.js\n) and add them there.\n\n\nsails.config.port\n#\n\n\nThe \nport\n setting determines which \nTCP port\n your Sails app will use to listen for incoming requests.  Ports are a \ntransport-layer\n concept designed to allow many different networking applications to run at the same time on a single computer.\n\n\nBy default, if it\u2019s set, Sails uses the port configured in your app (\nsails.config.port\n).  If not, it checks to see if the \nPORT\n environment variable is set, and uses that if possible.  Otherwise it falls back to port 1337.\n\n\n\n\nIn production, you will probably want Sails to listen on port 80 (or 443, if you have an SSL certificate and are serving your site via \nhttps://\n.)  But depending on where your app is deployed, you may or may not need to actually modify this setting.  For example, if you are deploying to a PaaS like \nHeroku\n, \nAzure App Service\n, or \nDeis\n, you may not need to configure \nsails.config.port\n, since in most cases it is handled automatically.  For more guidance and tips related to deploying, scaling, and maintaining Sails in production, see \nConcepts > Deployment\n.\n\n\n\n\nsails.config.explicitHost\n#\n\n\nBy default, Sails will assume \nlocalhost\n as the host that will be listening for incoming requests.  This will work in the majority of hosting environments you encounter, but in some cases (\nOpenShift\n being one example) you'll need to explicitly declare the host name of your Sails app.  Setting \nexplicitHost\n tells Sails to listen for requests on that host instead of \nlocalhost\n.\n\n\nsails.config.proxyHost\n and \nsails.config.proxyPort\n#\n\n\nIf your site will ultimately be served by a proxy, you may want to set \nproxyHost\n to ensure that calls to \nsails.getBaseurl()\n return the expected host.  For example, if you deploy a Sails app on \nModulus.io\n, the ultimate URL for your site will be something like \nhttp://mysite-12345.onmodulus.net\n.  If you were to use \nsails.getBaseurl()\n to construct a URL in your app code, however, it would return something like \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.  Using \nproxyHost\n and \nproxyPort\n allow you to specify the host name and port of the proxy server that will be serving your app.  This ensure that any links created using \nsails.getBaseurl()\n are correct.\n\n\nsails.config.environment\n#\n\n\nThe runtime \u201cenvironment\u201d of your Sails app is usually either \u2018development\u2019 or \u2018production\u2019.\n\n\nIn development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and debugging output).\n\n\nIn production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to optimize performance.  You should always put your app in production mode before you deploy it to a server -- this helps ensure that your Sails app remains stable, performant, and scalable.\n\n\nUsing the \"production\" environment\n#\n\n\nBy default, Sails determines its environment using the \nNODE_ENV\n environment variable. If \nNODE_ENV\n is not set, Sails will look to see if you provided a \nsails.config.environment\n setting, and use it if possible.  Otherwise, it runs in the \u2018development\u2019 environment.\n\n\nWhen you lift your app with the NODE_ENV environment variable to \"production\", Sails automatically sets \nsails.config.environment\n to \"production\" too.  In fact, the reccommended way of switching to production mode is by \nsetting the NODE_ENV environment variable\n to \"production\".  This is usually a better idea than configuring \nsails.config.environment\n manually, since the NODE_ENV environment variable is relied upon by some of Sails' dependencies, and automatically set by most Sails/Node.js hosting services.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to Sails v1.0, the opposite was also true (Sails set the NODE_ENV environment variable to \"production\" automatically when lifting with \nsails.config.environment\n set to \"production).  In Sails v1.0, that \nis changing\n to provide better support for custom staging and sandbox environments.\n\n\nFor more background on configuring your Sails app for production, see \nConcepts > Deployment\n.\n\n\n\n\nsails.config.hookTimeout\n#\n\n\nSet a global timeout for Sails hooks, in milliseconds.  Sails will give up trying to lift if any hook takes longer than this to load.  Defaults to \n20000\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common use for this setting is to tolerate slow production Grunt tasks.  For example, if your app is using uglify, and you have lots and lots of client-side JavaScript files in your assets folder, then you might need Sails to wait longer than 20 seconds to compile all of those client-side assets.  For more tips about the production asset pipeline, see \nConcepts > Deployment\n.\n\n\n\n\nsails.config.keepResponseErrors\n#\n\n\nBy default, convenience functions \nbadRequest\n, \nforbidden\n, \nnotFound\n, and \nserverError\n will clear the response body when the environment is \"production\".  This behavior may be undesirable in certain cases, such as exposing underlying Waterline validation errors to clients while responding through \nbadRequest\n.\n\n\nSet \nkeepResponseErrors\n to \ntrue\n to ensure Sails preserves the response body for these functions.\n\n\n\n\nThe default behavior of responses will be \nchanging a bit in Sails v1.0\n.\n\n\n\n\nsails.config.ssl\n#\n\n\nSSL/TLS (transport-layer security) is critical for preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.  Without a protocol like SSL/TLS, web basics like securely transmitting login credentials and credit card numbers would be much more complicated and troublesome.  SSL/TLS is not only important for HTTP requests (\nhttps://\n); it's also necessary for WebSockets (over \nwss://\n).  Fortunately, you only need to worry configuring SSL settings in once place: \nsails.config.ssl\n.\n\n\n\n\nSSL and Load Balancers\n#\n\n\nThe \nsails.config.ssl\n setting is only relevant if you want your \nSails process\n to manage SSL.  This isn't always true.  For example, if you plan for your Sails app to get more and more traffic, it will need to scale to multiple servers, which means you'll need a load balancer.  Most of the time, for performance and simplicity, it is a good idea to terminate SSL at your load balancer.  If you do that, then since SSL/TLS will have already been dealt with \nbefore packets reach your Sails app\n, you actually won't need to use the \nsails.config.ssl\n setting at all.  (This is also true if you're using a PaaS like Heroku, or almost any other host with a built-in load balancer.)\n\n\nIf you're satisfied this configuration setting applies to your app, then please continue below for more details.\n\n\n\n\nUse \nsails.config.ssl\n to set up basic SSL server options, or to indicate that you will be specifying more advanced options in \nsails.config.http.serverOptions\n.\n\n\nIf you specify a dictionary, it should contain both \nkey\n \nand\n \ncert\n keys, \nor\n a \npfx\n key. The presence of those options indicates to Sails that your app should be lifted with an HTTPS server.  If your app requires a more complex SSL setup (for example by using \nSNICallback\n), set \nsails.config.ssl\n to \ntrue\n and specify your advanced options in \nsails.config.http.serverOptions\n.\n\n\nSSL Configuration Example\n#\n\n\nFor this example, we'll assume you created a folder in your project, \nconfig/ssl/\n and dumped your certificate/key files inside.  Then, in one of your config files, include the following:\n\n\n// Assuming this is in `config/env/production.js`, and your folder of SSL cert/key files is in `config/ssl/`:\n\nssl: {\n  ca: require('fs').readFileSync(require('path').resolve(__dirname,'../ssl/my-gd-bundle.crt')),\n  key: require('fs').readFileSync(require('path').resolve(__dirname,'../ssl/my-ssl.key')),\n  cert: require('fs').readFileSync(require('path').resolve(__dirname,'../ssl/my-ssl.crt'))\n}",

You can also specify connections in your \nconfig/local.js\n or \nenvironment-specific\n config files.\n\n\nSails adapters have been written for a variety of popular databases such as MySQL, Postgres and Mongo.  You can find a list of supported adapters \nhere\n.\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\nTo use the \nsails-memory\n adapter (useful for DEVELOPMENT ONLY), first install the module with \nnpm install sails-memory\n, then define it in \nconnections.js\n:\n\n\nHere is an example adapter configuration file\n\n\nmyApp/config/connections.js\n\n\nmodule.exports.connections = {\n  // sails-disk is installed by default.\n  localDiskDb: {\n    adapter: 'sails-disk'\n  },\n  memory: {\n    adapter: 'sails-memory'\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to set \nmemory\n as the default adapter for your models, you would do this.\n\nmyApp/config/models.js\n\n\nmodule.exports.models = {\n\n  connection: 'memory'\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that options you define directly in your model definitions will override these settings.\nPrior to v0.10, adapters were defined in \nmyApp/config/Adapters.js\n.  See v0.9 docs for more info.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple connections for an adapter\n#\n\n\nYou can set up more than one connection using the same adapter.

For apps running behind particular combinations of load balancers, proxies, and/or SSL, it may be necessary to increase this delay (see https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/issues/71#issuecomment-217556631).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaxTimeToWaitForFirstFile\n\n\n((number))\n\n\n10000\n\n\nThe maximum number of miliseconds to wait for the first file upload to arrive in any given upstream before triggering \n.upload()\n's callback.

Incoming bytes are managed using \na combination of buffering and TCP backpressure\n built in to Node.js streams.  The max buffer time is a configurable layer of defense to protect against denial of service attacks that attempt to flood servers with pending file uploads.  If the timeout is exceeded, an EMAXBUFFER error will fire.  The best defense against these types of attacks is to plug incoming file uploads into receivers as early as possible at the top of your controller actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrict\n\n\n((boolean))\n\n\ntrue\n\n\nWhen enabled, only arrays and dictionaries (i.e. JavaScript objects) will be interpeted and parsed as JSON when sent in the HTTP request body.

Property  Type  Default  Details      maxWaitTimeBeforePassingControlToApp  ((number))  500  The maximum number of miliseconds to wait when processing an incoming multipart request before passing control to your app's policies and controllers.  If this number of miliseconds goes by, and no incoming file uploads have arrived yet, and the request hasn't finished sending other data like text parameters (i.e. the form emits \"close\"), then control will be passed without further delay.  For apps running behind particular combinations of load balancers, proxies, and/or SSL, it may be necessary to increase this delay (see https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/issues/71#issuecomment-217556631).    maxTimeToWaitForFirstFile  ((number))  10000  The maximum number of miliseconds to wait for the first file upload to arrive in any given upstream before triggering  .upload() 's callback.  If the first file upload on a given upstream does not arrive before this number of miliseconds have elapsed, then an  ETIMEOUT  error will fire.    maxBufferTime  ((number))  4500  The maximum number of miliseconds to wait for any given live  upstream  to be plugged in to a receiver after it begins receiving an incoming file upload.  Skipper pauses upstreams to allow custom code in your app's policies and controller actions to run (e.g. doing database lookups) before you \"plug in\" the incoming file uploads (e.g.  req.file('avatar').upload(...) ) into your desired upload target (local disk, S3, gridfs, etc).  Incoming bytes are managed using  a combination of buffering and TCP backpressure  built in to Node.js streams.  The max buffer time is a configurable layer of defense to protect against denial of service attacks that attempt to flood servers with pending file uploads.  If the timeout is exceeded, an EMAXBUFFER error will fire.  The best defense against these types of attacks is to plug incoming file uploads into receivers as early as possible at the top of your controller actions.    strict  ((boolean))  true  When enabled, only arrays and dictionaries (i.e. JavaScript objects) will be interpeted and parsed as JSON when sent in the HTTP request body.

To do so, you will need to set \nsails.config.session.adapter\n, set up your session database, and then add any other configuration specific to the Connect session adapter you are using.\n\n\nConfiguring Redis as Your Session Store\n#\n\n\nThe most popular session store for production Sails applications is Redis.  It works great as a session database since it is inherently good at ephemeral storage, but Redis' popularity probably has more to do with the fact that, if you are using sockets and plan to scale your app to multiple servers, you will \nneed a Redis instance\n anyway.\n\n\nThe easiest way to set up Redis as your app's shared session store is to uncomment the following line in \nconfig/session.js\n:\n\n\nadapter: 'connect-redis',\n\n\n\n\nThen install the \nconnect-redis\n session adapter as a dependency of your app:\n\n\nnpm install connect-redis@~3.0.2 --save --save-exact\n\n\n\n\nThe following settings are optional, since if no redis configuration other than \nadapter\n is provided, Sails assumes you want it to use a redis instance running on \nlocalhost\n.\n\n\n  host: 'localhost',\n  port: 6379,\n  ttl: <redis session TTL in seconds>,\n  db: 0,\n  pass: <redis auth password>\n  prefix: 'sess:'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndb\n\n\n((number))\n\n\nundefined\n\n\nThe index of the database to use within your redis instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\n((string))\n\n\n'127.0.0.1'\n\n\nHostname of your redis instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npass\n\n\n((string))\n\n\nundefined\n\n\nThe password for your redis instance.

You can read more about these, and other available options, at \nhttps://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo\n:\n\n\n  // Note: user, pass and port are optional\n  url: 'mongodb://user:pass@host:port/database',\n  collection: 'sessions',\n  auto_reconnect: false,\n  ssl: false,\n  stringify: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n When using Node version <= 0.12.x, install \nconnect-mongo\n version 0.8.2.  For Node version >= 4.0, install \nconnect-mongo\n version \n1.1.0\n.\n\n If you run into kerberos-related issues when using the MongoDB as your session store or the database for one or more of your app's models, be sure and have a look at the relevant \ntroubleshooting page\n in the Mongo docs.  Also see \n#3362\n for more diagnostic information about using Kerberos with Mongo in your Sails app.\n\n\n\n\nDisabling sessions\n#\n\n\nSessions are enabled by default in Sails.  To disable sessions in your app, disable the \nsession\n hook by changing your \n.sailsrc\n file.  The process for disabling \nsession\n is identical to the process for \ndisabling the Grunt hook\n (just type \nsession: false\n instead of \ngrunt: false\n).\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nIf the session hook is disabled, the session secret configured as \nsails.config.session.secret\n will still be used to support signed cookies, if relevant.

Sails helps smooth away some of this complexity by introducing the concept of \nresourceful pubsub\n (\nPublish / Subscribe\n).  Every model (AKA \nresource\n) in your app is automatically equipped with class methods which provide a conventional, data-centric interface for both \nbroadcasting notifications\n and \nsubscribing sockets to notifications\n about individual database records being created, updated, or destroyed.\n\n\nIf your app is currently using the \nBlueprint API\n, you are already using resourceful pubsub methods!  They are embedded in the default blueprint actions bundled with Sails, and called automatically when those actions run; causing requesting sockets to be subscribed when data is fetched and messages to be broadcasted to already-subscribed sockets when data is changed.\n\n\nBut even when writing custom code, you can call the methods described in this section manually in lieu of using \nsails.sockets.*\n methods directly.  Think of resourceful pubsub methods as a way of standardizing the interface for socket communication across your application: things like the names for rooms, the schema for data transmitted as socket messages, and the names of socket events.  These methods are designed \nexclusively\n for scenarios where one or more user interfaces are listening to socket events as a way of keeping in sync with the backend.  If that does not fit your use case or if you are having trouble deciding, don't worry; just call \nsails.sockets.broadcast()\n, \nsails.sockets.join()\n, or \nsails.sockets.leave()\n directly instead.  It is perfectly acceptable to use either approach, or even \nboth\n approaches in the same app.\n\n\nListening for events on the client\n#\n\n\nWhile you are free to use any Javascript library to listen for socket events on the client, Sails provides its own socket client called \nsails.io.js\n as a convenient way to communicate with the Sails server from any web browser or Node.js process that supports Socket.io.  Using the Sails socket client makes listening for resourceful pubsub events as easy as:\n\n\nio.socket.on('<model identity>', function (event) {\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmodel identity\n is typically the lowercased version of the model name, unless it has been manually configured in the model file.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n#\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a model named \nUser\n in your app, with a single \u201cname\u201d attribute.  First, we\u2019ll add a listener for \u201cuser\u201d events:\n\n\nio.socket.on('user', function(event){console.log(event);})\n\n\n\n\nThis will log any notifications about \nUser\n models to the console.  However, we won\u2019t receive any such messages until we \nsubscribe\n to the existing \nUser\n records (aka model instances).  If your app currently has the blueprint API enabled, you can use the sails.io.js client to watch the User model\u00a0for new records, as well as subscribing to the returned set of records by making a socket \nGET\n request from the client to \n/user\n:\n\n\nio.socket.get('/user', function(resData, jwres) {console.log(resData);})\n\n\n\n\nThis requests the current list of users from the Sails server, and subscribes the client to events about each user.  Additionally, if the \nautoWatch\n setting\n is on (the default), the client will also be notified whenever a new \nUser\n is created, and will automatically be subscribed to the new user.  The callback in this example simply logs the user list to the console.  See the \nsocket.get\n reference for more info about this method.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in order for the subscription to take place, the \n/user\n request must be made via a websocket call, \nnot\n a regular HTTP request.  That is, using an AJAX request (e.g. \njQuery.get(\"/user\")\n) will \nnot\n result in the client being subscribed to resourceful pubsub messages about \nUser\n.  However, once the subscription is made, \nany\n changes to models--whether they be the result of a socket call, an AJAX request, even a cURL request from the command line--will cause the client to receive a notification.  Continuing with the above example, if you were to open up a new browser window and go to the following URL:\n\n\n/user/create?name=joe\n\n\n\n\nYou would see something like the following in the console of the first window:\n\n\n{\n    verb: 'created',\n  id: 1,\n  data: {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'joe',\n    createdAt: '2014-08-01T05:50:19.855Z'\n    updatedAt: '2014-08-01T05:50:19.855Z'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nverb\n indicates the kind of action that occurred.  The \nid\n refers to the record that the alleged action occurred on, and \ndata\n contains new/modified information about the \nUser\n that was acted upon.  Each event type sends back slightly different information; see the individual resourceful pubsub method reference documents for more info.",

            "text": "Socket Client (\nsails.io.js\n)\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the docs is about the Sails socket client SDK for the browser.  It is written in JavaScript and is also usable on the server.\n\n\nThere are also a handful of community projects implementing Sails/Socket.io clients for native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nThe Sails socket client (\nsails.io.js\n) is a tiny browser library that is bundled by default in new Sails apps.  It is a lightweight wrapper that sits on top of the Socket.IO client whose purpose is to make sending and receiving messages from your Sails backend as simple as possible.\n\n\nThe main responsibility of \nsails.io.js\n is to provide a familiar ajax-like interface for communicating with your Sails app using WebSockets/Socket.io.  That basically means providing \n.get()\n, \n.post()\n, \n.put()\n, and \n.delete()\n methods that let you take advantage of realtime features while still reusing the same backend routes you're using for the rest of your app.  In other words, running \nio.socket.post('/user')\n in your browser will be routed within your Sails app exactly the same as an HTTP POST request to the same route.\n\n\nBasic usage (browser)\n#\n\n\nIn the browser, all that is required to use \nsails.io.js\n is to include the library in a \n<SCRIPT>\n tag.  Sails adds the library to the \nassets/js/dependencies\n folder of all new apps, so you can do:\n\n\n<!--\n  This will import the sails.io.js library bundled in your Sails app by default.\n  The bundled version embeds minified code for the Socket.io client as well.\n  One tick of the event loop after importing this script, a new \"eager\" socket\n  will automatically be created begin connecting unless you configure it not to.\n-->\n<script type\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n\nand then use \nio.socket\n as a global variable in subsequent inline or external scripts.  For detailed instructions and examples of everyday usage, see \nio.socket\n.\n\n\nBasic usage (Node.js)\n#\n\n\nTo use the Sails socket client SDK in a Node.js script, you will need to install and require both the \nsails.io.js\n and \nsocket.io-client\n libraries:\n\n\n// Initialize the sails.io.js library with the socket.io-client module,\n// which will automatically create and connect a new socket as io.socket\n// unless you configure it not to.\nvar io = require('sails.io.js')( require('socket.io-client') );\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nsails.io.js GitHub repo\n for more information on using the Sails socket client from Node.js.\n\n\nConfiguring the \nsails.io.js\n library\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section focuses on the most common runtime environment for the JavaScript socket client: the browser.  See the \nsails.io.js\n GitHub repository\n for help configuring the socket client for use in a Node.js script.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to configure Sails' socket client in the browser: using HTML attributes on the \n<script>\n tag or by programmatically modifying the \nio.sails\n object.\n\n\nBasic configuration using HTML attributes\n#\n\n\nThe easiest way to configure the four most common settings for the socket client (\nautoConnect\n, \nenvironment\n, \nheaders\n, and \nurl\n) is by sticking one or more HTML attributes on the script tag:\n\n\n<script src=\"/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\"\n  autoConnect=\"false\"\n  environment=\"production\"\n  headers='{ \"x-csrf-token\": \"<%= typeof _csrf === 'undefined' ? _csrf : '' %>\" }'\n></script>\n\n\n\n\nThis example will disable the eager socket connection, force the client environment to \"production\" (which disables logs), and set an \nx-csrf-token\n header that will be sent in every socket request (unless overridden).  Note that comoposite values like the \nheaders\n dictionary are wrapped in a pair of \nsingle-quotes\n.  That's because composite values specified this way must be \nJSON-encoded\n-- meaning they must use double-quotes around string values \nand\n around key names. \n\n\nAny configuration which may be provided as an HTML attribute may alternately be provided prefixed with \ndata-\n (e.g. \ndata-autoConnect\n, \ndata-environment\n, \ndata-headers\n, \ndata-url\n).  This is for folks who need to support browsers that have issues with nonstandard HTML attributes (or if the idea of using nonstandard HTML attributes just creeps you out). If both the standard HTML attribute and the \ndata-\n prefixed HTML attribute are provided, the latter takes precendence.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n \nIn order to use this approach for configuring the socket client, if you are using the default Grunt asset pipeline (i.e. which automatically injects script tags), you will need to remove \nsails.io.js\n from your \npipeline.js\n file, and instead include an explicit \n<script>\n tag which imports it.\n\n\n\n\nProgrammatic configuration using \nio.sails\n#\n\n\nAs of Sails v0.12.x, only the most basic configuration options may be set using HTML attributes.  If you want to configure any of the other options not mentioned above, you will need to interact with \nio.sails\n programmatically.  Fortunately, the approach described above is really just a convenient shortcut for doing just that!  Heres how it works:\n\n\nWhen you load it on the page in a \n<script>\n tag, the \nsails.io.js\n library waits for one cycle of the event loop before \nautomatically connecting\n a socket (if \nio.sails.autoConnect\n is enabled; \nsee below\n).  This is to allow any properties that you specify on \nio.sails\n to be set before the socket begins connecting.  However, in order to ensure that the \nio.sails\n properties are read before connection, you should put the code setting those properties immediately after the \n<script>\n tag that includes \nsails.io.js\n:\n\n\n<script src=\"/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  io.sails.url = 'https://myapp.com';\n</script>\n<!-- ...other scripts... -->\n\n\n\n\nNormally, the socket client always connects to the server where the script is being served.  The example above will cause the eager (auto-connecting) socket to attempt a (cross-domain) socket connection to the Sails server running at \nhttps://myapp.com\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n \nIf you are using the default Grunt asset pipeline (i.e. which automatically injects script tags), it is a good idea to exclude \nsails.io.js\n from your \npipeline.js\n file, and instead explicitly add a \n<script>\n tag for it.  This ensures that your configuration will be applied \nbefore\n the \"eager\" auto-connecting socket begins connecting-- since it means the inline \n<script>\n tag you are using for programmatic configuration (e.g. which sets \nio.sails.url = 'https://myapp.com';\n) is executed \nimmediately after\n the socket client.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced usage\n#\n\n\nYou can also create and connect client sockets manually using \nio.sails.connect\n.  This returns an instance of the \nSailsSocket\n. For more information about rarer / more advanced use cases such as connecting multiple sockets, see \nSailsSocket\n.\n\n\nAdvanced configuration\n#\n\n\nThe \nsails.io.js\n library and its individual client sockets have a handful of configuration options.  Global configuration lives in \nio.sails\n.  This includes the ability to disable the \"eager\" socket and default settings for new sockets.  Individual sockets can also be configured when they are manually connected-- see \nio.sails.connect()\n for more information on that.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n#\n\n\nCan I use this with XYZ front-end framework?\n#\n\n\nYes.  The Sails socket client can be used to great effect with any front-end framework-- no matter whether it's angular, react, ember, backbone, knockout, jQuery, \nFishBerry\n, etc.\n\n\nDo I have to use this?\n#\n\n\nNo. The Sails socket client is extremely helpful when building realtime/chat features in a browser-based UI, but like the rest of the \nassets/\n directory, it is probably not particularly useful if you are building a \nnative Android app\n, or an API with no user interface at all.\n\n\nFortunately, like every other boilerplate file and folder in Sails, the socket client is completely optional. To remove it, just delete \nassets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n.\n\n\nHow does this work?\n#\n\n\nUnder the covers, the socket client (\nsails.io.js\n) emits Socket.io messages with reserved names that, when interpreted by Sails, are routed to the appropriate policies/controllers/etc. according to your app's routes and blueprint configuration.\n\n\nCan I bypass this client and use Socket.io directly?\n#\n\n\nIt is possible to bypass the request interpreter in your Sails app and communicate with Socket.io directly.  However, it is not reccommended, since it breaks the convention over configuration philosophy used elsewhere in the framework.    The Sails socket client (\nsails.io.js\n) is unobtrusive:  it works by wrapping the native socket.io client and exposing a higher level API that takes advantage of the virtual request interpreter in Sails to send simulated HTTP requests.  This makes your backend code more reusable, reduces the barrier to entry for developers new to using WebSockets/Socket.io, and keeps your app easier to reason about.  \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nUnder very rare circumstances (e.g. compatibility with an existing/legacy frontend using socket.io directly), bypassing the request interpreter is a \nrequirement\n.  If you find yourself in this position, you can use the socket.io client SDK, and then use \nsails.io\n on the backend to access the raw Socket.io instance.  Please embark down this road only if you have extensive experience working directly with Socket.io; and only if you have first reviewed the internals of the \nsockets\n hook\n (particularly the \"admin bus\" implementation, a Redis integration that sits on top of socket.io-redis and powers Sails' multi-server support for joining/leaving rooms.)",

The main responsibility of  sails.io.js  is to provide a familiar ajax-like interface for communicating with your Sails app using WebSockets/Socket.io.

Note that comoposite values like the  headers  dictionary are wrapped in a pair of  single-quotes .  That's because composite values specified this way must be  JSON-encoded -- meaning they must use double-quotes around string values  and  around key names.   Any configuration which may be provided as an HTML attribute may alternately be provided prefixed with  data-  (e.g.  data-autoConnect ,  data-environment ,  data-headers ,  data-url ).  This is for folks who need to support browsers that have issues with nonstandard HTML attributes (or if the idea of using nonstandard HTML attributes just creeps you out). If both the standard HTML attribute and the  data-  prefixed HTML attribute are provided, the latter takes precendence.   Note:  \nIn order to use this approach for configuring the socket client, if you are using the default Grunt asset pipeline (i.e. which automatically injects script tags), you will need to remove  sails.io.js  from your  pipeline.js  file, and instead include an explicit  <script>  tag which imports it.",

Contributors work carefully to ensure best practices, but we also rely heavily on the community when it comes to discovering, reporting, and remediating security issues.\n\n\nSubscribe to announcements\n#\n\n\nSecurity announcements are sent to the Sails \nnewsgroup\n, and are released roughly at the same time NSP advisories are issued.\n\n\nReporting a security issue in Sails\n#\n\n\nIf you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Sails, Waterline, or one of the other modules maintained by the Sails core team, please send an email to \ncritical at treeline dot io\n.  In the spirit of \nresponsible disclosure\n, we ask that you privately report any security vulnerability at that email address, and give us time to patch the issue before publishing the details\n.\n\n\nWhat is a security vulnerability?\n#\n\n\nA security vulnerability is any major bug or unintended consequence that could compromise a Sails.js app in production.\n\n\nFor example, an issue where Sails crashes in a development environment when using non-standard Grunt tasks is \nnot a security vulnerability\n.  On the other hand, if it was possible to perform a trivial DoS attack on a Sails cluster running in a production environment and using documented best-practices (a la the \nExpress/Connect body parser issue\n), that \nis a security vulnerability\n and we want to know about it.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this definition includes any such vulnerability that exists due to one of our dependencies.  In this case, an upgrade to a different version of the dependency is not always necessary: for example, when Express 3 deprecated multipart upload support in core, Sails.js dealt with the feature mismatch by implementing a wrapper around the \nmultiparty\n module called \nSkipper\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should be included in the email?\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe name and NPM version string of the module where you found the security vulnerability (e.g. Sails, Waterline, other core module).\n\n\nA summary of the vulnerability\n\n\nThe code you used when you discovered the vulnerability or a code example of the vulnerability (whichever is shorter).\n\n\nWhether you want us to make your involvement public.

Note that this definition includes any such vulnerability that exists due to one of our dependencies.  In this case, an upgrade to a different version of the dependency is not always necessary: for example, when Express 3 deprecated multipart upload support in core, Sails.js dealt with the feature mismatch by implementing a wrapper around the  multiparty  module called  Skipper .",

            "text": "Upgrading to v0.10\n#\n\n\nFor the most part, running sails lift in an existing v0.9 project should just work. The core contributors have taken a number of steps to make the upgrade as easy as possible, and if you follow the deprecation messages in the console, you should do just fine.\n\n\nSails v0.10 comes with some big changes. The sections below provide a high level overview of what's changed, major bug fixes, enhancements and new features, as well as a basic tutorial on how to upgrade your v0.9.x Sails app to v0.10.\n\n\nFile uploads\n#\n\n\nThe Connect multipart middleware \nwill soon be officially deprecated\n. But since this module was used as the built-in HTTP body parser in Sails v0.9 and Express v3, this is a breaking change for v0.9 Sails projects relying on \nreq.files\n.\n\n\nBy default in v0.10, Sails includes \nskipper\n, a body parser which allows for streaming file uploads without buffering tmp files to disk. For run-of-the-mill file upload use cases, Skipper comes with bundled support for uploads to local disk (via skipper-disk), but streaming uploads can be plugged in to any of its supported adapters.\n\n\nFor examples/documentation, please see the Skipper repository as well as the Sails documentation on \nreq.file()\n.\n\n\nWhy?\n#\n\n\nA body parser's job is to parse the \"body\" of incoming multipart HTTP requests. Sometimes, that \"body\" includes text parameters, but sometimes, it includes file uploads.\n\n\nConnect multipart is great code, and it supports both file uploads AND text parameters in multipart requests. But like most modules of its kind, it accomplishes this by buffering file uploads to disk. This can quickly overwhelm a server's available disk space, and in many cases exposes a serious DoS attack vulnerability.\n\n\nSkipper is unique in that it supports \nstreaming\n file uploads, but also maintains support for metadata in the request body (i.e. JSON/XML/urlencoded request body parameters). It uses a handful of heuristics to make sure only the files you're expecting get plugged in and received by the blob adapter, and other (potentially malicous) file fields are ignored.\n\n\n\n\n Important!\n#\n\n\nFor Skipper to work, you \nmust include all text parameters BEFORE file parameters\n in file upload requests to the server. Once Skipper sees the first file field, it stops waiting for text parameters (this is to avoid unnecessary/unsafe buffering of file data).\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring a different body parser\n#\n\n\nAs with most things in Sails, you can use any Connect/Express/Sails-compatible bodyparser you like. To switch back to \nconnect-multipart\n, or any other body parser (like \nformidable\n or \nbusboy\n), change your app's http configuration.\n\n\nBlueprints\n#\n\n\nA new blueprint action (\nfindOne\n) has been added. For instance, if you have a \nFooController\n and \nFoo\n model, then send a request to \n/foo/5\n, the \nfindOne\n action in your \nFooController\n will run. If you don't have a \nfindOne\n action, the \nfindOne\n blueprint action will be used in its stead. Requests sent to \n/foo\n will still run the find controller/blueprint action.\n\n\nPolicies\n#\n\n\nPolicies work exactly as they did in v0.9- however there is a new consideration you should take into account: Due to the introduction of the more specific \nfindOne()\n blueprint action mentioned above, you will want to make sure you're handling it explicitly in your policy mapping configuration.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you have a v0.9 app whose \npolicies.js\n configuration prevents access to the \nfind\n action in your \nDoveController\n:\n\n\nmodule.exports.policies = {\n  '*': true,\n  DoveController: {\n    find: false\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nAssuming rest blueprint routes are enabled, this would prevent access to requests like both \n/dove\n and \n/dove/14\n. But now in v0.10, since \n/dove/14\n will actually run the \nfindOne\n action, we must handle it explicitly:\n\n\nmodule.exports.policies = {\n  '*': true,\n  DoveController: {\n    find: false,\n    findOne: false\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n\nPubsub\n#\n\n\nSummary\n#\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n socket (i.e. \"comment\") event on client is now \nmodelIdentity\n (where \"modelIdentity\" is different depending on the model that the \npublish*()\n method was called from.\n\n\nClients are no longer subscribed to model-creation events by the blueprint routes. To listen for creation events, use \nModel.watch()\n.\n\n\nThe events that were formerly \ncreate\n, \nupdate\n, and \ndestroy\n are now \ncreated\n, \nupdated\n, and \ndestroyed\n.\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n#\n\n\nThe biggest change to pubsub is that Socket.io events are emitted under the name of the model emitting them. Previously, your client listened for the \nmessage\n event and then had to determine which model it came from based on the included data:\n\n\nsocket.on('message', function(cometEvent) {\n   if (cometEvent.model == 'user') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n   }\n   else if (cometEvent.model === 'product') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n   }\n   // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, you subscribe to the identity of the model:\n\n\nsocket.on('user', function(cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n});\n\nsocket.on('product', function (cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n});\n\n\n\n\nThis helps to structure your front end code.\n\n\nThe way you subscribe clients to models has also changed. Previously, you specified whether you were subscribing to the model class (class room) or one or more model instances based on the parameters that you passed to \nModel.subscribe\n. It was effectively one method to do two very different things.\n\n\nNow, you use \nModel.subscribe()\n to subscribe only to model instances (records). You can also specify event \"contexts\", or types, that you'd like to hear about. For example, if you only wanted to get messages about updates to an instance, you would call \nUser.subscribe(req, myUser, 'update')\n. If no context is given in a call to \n.subscribe()\n, then all contexts specified by the model class's autosubscribe property will be used.\n\n\nTo subscribe to model creation events, you can now use \nModel.watch()\n. Upon subscription, your clients will receive messages every time a new record is created on that model using the blueprint routes, and will automatically be subscribed to the new instance as well.\n\n\nRemember, when working with blueprints, clients are no longer auto subscribed to the class room. This must be done manually.\n\n\nFinally, if you want to see all pubsub messages from all models, you can access the \nfirehose\n, a development-only tool that broadcasts messages about \neverything\n that happens to your models. You can subscribe to the firehose using \nsails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose(socket)\n, or on the front end by making a socket request to \n/firehose\n. The firehose will broadcast a \nfirehose\n event whenever a model is created, updated, destroyed, added to, removed from or messaged. This effectively replaces the \nmessage\n event used in previous Sails versions.\n\n\nTo see examples of the new pubsub methods in action, see \nSailsChat\n.\n\n\nArguments to lifecycle callbacks are now typecasted\n#\n\n\nPreviously, with \nschema: true\n, if you sent an attribute value to a \n.create()\n or \n.update()\n that did not match the expected type declared in the model's attributes, the value you passed in would still be accessible in your model's lifecycle callbacks.\n\n\nIn Sails/Waterline v0.10, this is no longer the case. Values passed to \n.create()\n and \n.update()\n are type-casted before your lifecycle callbacks run. Affected lifecycle callbacks include \nbeforeUpdate()\n, \nbeforeCreate()\n, and \nbeforeValidate()\n.\n\n\nbeforeValidation() is now beforeValidate()\n#\n\n\nIf you were using the \nbeforeValidation\n or \nafterValidation\n model lifecycle callbacks in any of your models, you should change them to \nbeforeValidate\n or \nafterValidate\n. This change was made in Waterline to match the style of the other lifecycle callbacks (e.g. \nbeforeCreate\n, \nafterUpdate\n, etc.).\n\n\n.done() vs. .exec()\n#\n\n\n The old (/confusing?) meaning of \n.done()\n has been deprecated.\n\n\nIn Sails <= v0.8, the syntax for executing an ORM query was \nModel. [ \u2026 ] .done( cb )\n. In v0.9, when promise support was added, the \nModel. [ \u2026 ] .exec( cb )\n became the recommended replacement, since \n.done()\n has a special meaning in the promise spec. However, the original usage of \n.done()\n was left untouched to make upgrading from v0.8 to v0.9 easier.\n\n\nBut as of Sails/Waterline v0.10, the original meaning of \n.done()\n has been officially deprecated to allow for a more robust promise implementation going forward, and pluggable promise library support (e.g. choose \nQ\n or \nBluebird\n etc.).\n\n\nAssociations\n#\n\n\nSails v0.10 introduces associations between data models. Since the work we've done on associations is largely additive, your existing models should still just work. That said, this is a powerful new feature that allows you to write less code and makes your app more maintainable, so we suggest taking advantage of it! To learn about how to use associations in Sails, check out the docs.\n\n\nAssociations (or \"relations\") are really just special attributes. Instead of string or integer values, you can specify an instance of a model or a collection of model instances. You can think about this kind of like an object (\n{...}\n) or an array (\n[{...}, {...}]\n) you might store as JSON in a NoSQL database. The difference is, in Sails, this works with any of the supported databases, and even allows you to populate (i.e. join) across different databases and types of databases.\n\n\nGenerators\n#\n\n\nSails has had support for generating code for a while now (e.g. \nsails generate controller foo\n) but in v0.10, we wanted to make this feature more extensible, open, and accessible to everybody in the Sails community. With that in mind, v0.10 comes with a complete rewrite of the command-line tool, and pluggable generators. Want to be able to run \nsails generate blog foo\n to make a new blog built on Sails? Create a \nblog\n generator (run sails \ngenerate generator blog\n), add your templates, and configure the generator to copy the new templates over. Then you can release it to the community by publishing an npm module called \nsails-generate-blog\n. Compatibility with Yeoman generators is also in our roadmap.\n\n\nCommand-line tool\n#\n\n\nThe big change here is how you create a new api. In the past you called \nsails generate new_api\n. This would generate a new controller and model called \nnew_api\n in the appropriate places. This is now done using \nsails generate api new_api\n.\n\n\nYou can still generate models and controllers seperately using the same CLI Commands.\n\n\nAlso, \n--linker\n switch is no longer available. In previous version, if \n--linker\n switch was provided, it created a \nmyApp/assets/linker folder\n, with \njs\n, \nstyles\n and \ntemplates\n folders inside. In this new version, the \nmyApp/assets/linker\n folder is not created. Compiling CoffeeScript and Less is the default behavior now, right from the \nmyApp/assets/js\n and \nmyApp/assets/scripts\n folders.\n\n\nCustom server responses\n#\n\n\nIn v0.10, you can now generate your own custom server responses.\n\n\nLike before, there are a few that we automatically create for you. Instead of generating \nmyApp/config/500.js\n and other \n.js\n responses in the config directory, they are now generated in \nmyApp/api/responses/\n.\n\n\nTo migrate, you will need to create a new v0.10 project and copy the \nmyApp/api/responses\n directory into your existing app. You will then modify the appropriate .js file to reflect any customization you made in your response logic files (500.js,etc).\n\n\nLegacy data stored in the temporary sails-disk database\n#\n\n\nsails-disk\n, used by default in new Sails projects, now stores data a bit differently. If you have some temporary data stored in a 0.9.x project, you'll want to wipe it out and start fresh. To do this:\n\n\nFrom your project's root directory:\n\n\n$ rm .tmp/disk.db\n\n\n\n\nAdapter/Database Configuration\n#\n\n\nconfig.adapters\n (in \nmyApp/config/adapters.js\n) is now config.connections (in new projects, this is generated in \nmyApp/config/connections.js\n). Also, \nconfig.model\n is now \nconfig.models\n.\n\n\nYour app's default \nconnection\n (i.e. database) should now be configured as a string \nconfig.models.connection\n used by default for model. New projects are generated with a \n/config/models.js\n file that includes the default connection.\n\n\nTo configure a model to use specific adapters, you must now specify them in the \nconnection\n key instead of \nadapters\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    connection: ['someMongoDatabase'],\n\n    attributes: {\n        name:{\n            type     : 'string',\n            required : true\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\nBlueprints/Controller configuration\n#\n\n\nThe object literal describing controller configuration overrides for controller blueprints should change from:\n\n\n...\n_config: {\n  blueprints: {\n    rest: true,\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nto:\n\n\n...\n_config: {\n    rest: true,\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nLayout paths:\n#\n\n\nIn Sails v0.9, you could use the following syntax to specify \nauth/someLayout.ejs\n as a custom layout when rendering a view:\n\n\nreturn res.view('auth/login',{\n  layout: 'someLayout'\n});\n\n\n\n\nHowever in Sails v0.10, all layout paths are relative to your app's views path. In other words, the relative path of the layout is no longer resolved from the view's own path-- it is now always resolved from the views path. This makes it easier to understand which file is being used, particularly when layout files have similar names:\n\n\nreturn res.view('auth/login', {\n  layout: 'auth/someLayout'\n});",

            "text": "The biggest change to pubsub is that Socket.io events are emitted under the name of the model emitting them. Previously, your client listened for the  message  event and then had to determine which model it came from based on the included data:  socket.on('message', function(cometEvent) {\n   if (cometEvent.model == 'user') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n   }\n   else if (cometEvent.model === 'product') {\n     // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n   }\n   // ...\n}  Now, you subscribe to the identity of the model:  socket.on('user', function(cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a user record\n});\n\nsocket.on('product', function (cometEvent) {\n  // Handle inbound messages related to a product record\n});  This helps to structure your front end code.  The way you subscribe clients to models has also changed. Previously, you specified whether you were subscribing to the model class (class room) or one or more model instances based on the parameters that you passed to  Model.subscribe . It was effectively one method to do two very different things.  Now, you use  Model.subscribe()  to subscribe only to model instances (records). You can also specify event \"contexts\", or types, that you'd like to hear about. For example, if you only wanted to get messages about updates to an instance, you would call  User.subscribe(req, myUser, 'update') . If no context is given in a call to  .subscribe() , then all contexts specified by the model class's autosubscribe property will be used.  To subscribe to model creation events, you can now use  Model.watch() . Upon subscription, your clients will receive messages every time a new record is created on that model using the blueprint routes, and will automatically be subscribed to the new instance as well.  Remember, when working with blueprints, clients are no longer auto subscribed to the class room. This must be done manually.  Finally, if you want to see all pubsub messages from all models, you can access the  firehose , a development-only tool that broadcasts messages about  everything  that happens to your models. You can subscribe to the firehose using  sails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose(socket) , or on the front end by making a socket request to  /firehose . The firehose will broadcast a  firehose  event whenever a model is created, updated, destroyed, added to, removed from or messaged. This effectively replaces the  message  event used in previous Sails versions.  To see examples of the new pubsub methods in action, see  SailsChat .",

To learn about how to use associations in Sails, check out the docs.  Associations (or \"relations\") are really just special attributes. Instead of string or integer values, you can specify an instance of a model or a collection of model instances. You can think about this kind of like an object ( {...} ) or an array ( [{...}, {...}] ) you might store as JSON in a NoSQL database.

            "text": "v0.11 Migration Guide\n#\n\n\ntldr;\n\n\nv0.11 comes with many minor improvements, as well as some internal cleanup in core.  The biggest change is that Sails core is now using Socket.io v1.\n\n\nAlmost none of this should affect the existing code in project, but there are a few important differences and new features to be aware of.  We've listed them below.\n\n\nDifferences\n#\n\n\nUpgrade the Socket.io / Sails.io browser client\n#\n\n\nOld v0.9 socket.io client will no longer work, so consequently you'll need to upgrade your sails.io.js client from v0.9 or v0.10 to v0.11.\n\n\nTo do this, just remove your sails.io.js client and install the new one.  We've bundled a helper generator that will do this for you, assuming your sails.io.js client is in the conventional location at \nassets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n (i.e. if you haven't moved or renamed it):\n\n\nsails generate sails.io.js --force\n\n\n\n\nonConnect\n lifecycle callback\n#\n\n\n\n\ntldr;\n\n\nRemove your \nonConnect\n function from \nconfig/sockets.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nonConnect\n lifecycle callback has been deprecated.  Instead, if you need to do something when a new socket is connected, send a request from the newly-connected client to do so.  The purpose of \nonConnect\n was always for optimizing performance (eliminating the need to do this initial extra round-trip with the server), yet its use can lead to confusion and race conditions. If you desperately need to eliminate the server roundtrip, you can bind a handler directly on \nsails.io.on('connect', function (newlyConnectedSocket){})\n in your bootstrap function (\nconfig/bootstrap.js\n). However, note that this is discouraged.  Unless you're facing \ntrue\n production performance issues, you should use the strategy mentioned above for your \"on connection\" logic (i.e. send an initial request from the client after the socket connects).  Socket requests are lightweight, so this doesn't add any tangible overhead to your application, and it will help make your code more predictable.\n\n\nonDisconnect\n lifecycle callback\n#\n\n\nThe \nonDisconnect\n lifecycle callback has been deprecated in favor of \nafterDisconnect\n.\n\n\nIf you were using \nonDisconnect\n previously, you might have had to change the \nsession\n, then call \nsession.save()\n manually.  In v0.11, this works in almost exactly the same way, except that \nafterDisconnect\n receives an additional 3rd argument: a callback function.  This way, you can just call the provided callback when your \nafterDisconnect\n logic has finished, so that Sails can persist any changes you've made to the session automatically.  Finally, as you might expect, you won't need to call \nsession.save()\n manually anymore- it is now taken care of for you (just like \nreq.session\n in a normal route, action, or policy.)\n\n\n\n\ntldr;\n\nRename your \nonDisconnect\n function in \nconfig/sockets.js\n with the following:\n\n\nafterDisconnect: function (session, socket, cb) {\n  // Be sure to call the callback\n  return cb();\n}\n\n\n\n\nOther configuration in \nconfig/sockets.js\n#\n\n\nMany of the configuration options in Socket.io v1 have changed, so you'll want to update your \nconfig/sockets.js\n file accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nif you haven\u2019t customized any of the options in \nconfig/sockets.js\n for your app, you can safely remove or comment out the entire file and let the Sails defaults do their magic.  Otherwise, refer to the new \nSails sockets  documentation\n to ensure that your configuration is still valid and avoid unwanted hair loss.\n\n\nif you are scaling to multiple servers in an environment that does \nnot support sticky sessions\n, you'll need to set your \ntransports\n to \n['websocket']\n in both \nconfig/socket.js\n and your client--see \nour Scaling doc\n for more info.\n\n\nif you were using a custom \nauthorization\n function to restrict socket connections, you'll now want to use \nbeforeConnect\n.  \nauthorization\n was deprecated by Socket.io v1, but \nbeforeConnect\n (which maps to the \nallowRequest\n option from Engine.io) works just the same way.\n\n\nif you were using other low-level socket configuration that was passed directly to socket.io v1, be sure and check out the \nreference page on sailsjs.org\n where all of the new configuration options are covered in detail.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"firehose\"\n#\n\n\nThe \"firehose\" feature for testing with sockets has been deprecated.  If you don't know what that means, you have nothing to worry about. The basic usage will continue to work for a while, but it will soon be removed from core and should not be relied upon in your app.  This also applies to the following methods:\n  + sails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose()\n  + sails.sockets.unsubscribeFromFirehose()\n  + sails.sockets.drink()\n  + sails.sockets.spit()\n  + sails.sockets.squirt()\n\n\n\n\nIf you want the \"firehose\" back, let \nMike know on twitter\n (it can be brought back as a separate hook).\n\n\n\n\nConfig files in subfolders\n#\n\n\nIt has always been the intention that files in the Sails \nconfig\n folder have no precedence over each other, and that the filenames and subfolders (with the exception of \nlocal.js\n and the \nenv\n and \nlocale\n subfolders) be used merely for organization.  However, in previous Sails versions, saving config files in subfolders would have the effect that the filename would be added as a key in \nsails.config\n, so that if you saved some config in \nconfig/foo/bar.js\n, then that config would be namespaced under \nsails.config.bar\n.  This was unintentional and potentially confusing as 1) the directory name is ignored, and 2) moving the file would change the config key.  This has been fixed in v0.11.x: config files in subfolders will be treated the same as those in the root \nconfig\n folder.  If you are for some reason relying on the old behavior, you may set \ndontFlattenConfig\n to \ntrue\n in your \n.sailsrc\n file, but we would strongly recommend that you instead just namespace the config yourself by setting the desired key on \nmodule.exports\n; for example \nmodule.exports.foo = {...}\n.  See \nissue #2544\n for more details.\n\n\nWaterline now uses Bluebird\n#\n\n\nAs of v0.11, Waterline now supports Bluebird (instead of q) for promises.  If you are using \n.exec()\n you won't be affected-- only if you are using \n.then()\n.  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/1186 for more information.\n\n\nNew features\n#\n\n\nSails v0.11 also comes with some new stuff that we thought you'd like to know about:\n\n\nUser-level hooks\n#\n\n\nHooks can now be installed directly from NPM.\n\n\nThis means you can now install hooks with a single command in your terminal.  For instance, consider the \nautoreload\n hook\n by \n@sgress454\n, which watches for changes to your backend code so you don't need to kill and re-lift the server every time you change your controllers, routes, models, etc.\n\n\nTo install the \nautoreload\n hook, run:\n\n\nnpm install sails-hook-autoreload\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one example of what's possible.  As you might already know, hooks are the lowest-level pluggable abstraction in Sails.  They allow authors to tap into the lift process, listen for events, inject custom \"shadow\" routes, and, in general, take advantage of raw access to the \nsails\n runtime.\nMost of the features you're familiar with in Sails have actually already been implemented as \"core\" hooks for over a year, including:\n\n\n\n\nblueprints\n \n(which provides the blueprint API)\n\n\nsockets\n    \n(which provides socket.io integration)\n\n\ngrunt\n      \n(which provides Grunt integration)\n\n\norm\n        \n(which provides integration with the Waterline ORM, and imports your projects adapters, models, etc.)\n\n\nhttp\n       \n(which provides an HTTP server)\n\n\nand 16 others.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about how to write your own hooks in the \nnew and improved \"Extending Sails\" documentation\n on http://sailsjs.org.\n\n\nSocket.io v1.x\n#\n\n\nThe upgrade to Socket.io v1.0 shouldn't actually affect your app-level code, provided you are using the layer of abstraction provided by Sails itself; everything from the \nsails.sockets.*\n wrapper methods and \"up\" (resourceful pubsub, blueprints)\nIf you are using underlying socket.io methods in your apps, or are just curious about what changed in Socket.io v1.0, be sure and check out the \ncomplete Socket.io 1.0 migration guide\n from Guillermo and the socket.io team.\n\n\nEver-increasing modularity\n#\n\n\nAs part of the upgrade to Socket.io v1.0, we pulled out the core \nsockets\n hook into a separate repository.  This allowed us to write some modular, hook-specific tests for the socket.io interpreter, which will make things easier to maintain, customize, and override.\nThis also allows the hook to grow at its own pace, and puts related issues in one place.\n\n\nConsider this a test of the pros and cons of pulling other hooks out of the sails core repo over the next few months.  This will make Sails core lighter, faster, and more extensible, with fewer core dependencies, shorter \"lift\" time for most apps, and faster \nnpm install\ns.\n\n\nTesting, the \"virtual\" request interpreter, and the \nsails.request()\n method\n#\n\n\nIn the process of pulling the \nsockets\n hook \nout\n of core, the logic which interprets requests has been normalized and is now located \nin\n Sails core.  As a result, the \nsails.request()\n method is much more powerful.\n\n\nThis method allows you to communicate directly with the request interpreter in Sails without lifting your server onto a port.  It's the same mechanism that Sails uses to map incoming messages from Socket.io to \"virtual requests\" that have the familiar \nreq\n and \nres\n streams.\n\n\nThe primary use case for \nsails.request()\n is in writing faster-running unit and integration tests, but it's also handy for proxying to mounted apps (or \"sub-apps\").\n\n\nFor instance, here is an example (using mocha) of how you might test one of your app's routes:\n\n\nvar assert = require('assert');\nvar Sails = require('sails').Sails;\n\nbefore(function beforeRunningAnyTests (done){\n\n  // Load the app (no need to \"lift\" to a port)\n  sails.load({\n    log: {\n      level: 'warn'\n    },\n    hooks: {\n      grunt: false\n    }\n  }, function whenAppIsReady(err){\n    if (err) return done(err);\n\n    // At this point, the `sails` global is exposed, although we\n    // could have disabled it above with our config overrides to\n    // `sails.load()`. In fact, you can actually use this technique\n    // to set any configuration setting you like.\n    return done();\n  });\n});\n\nafter(function afterTestsFinish (done) {\n  sails.lower(done);\n});\n\ndescribe('GET /hotpockets', function (){\n\n  it('should respond with a 200 status code', function (done){\n\n    sails.request({\n      method: 'get',\n      url: '/hotpockets',\n      params: {\n        limit: 10,\n        sort: 'price ASC'\n      }\n    }, function (err, clientRes, body) {\n      if (err) return done(err);\n\n      assert.equal(clientRes.statusCode, 200);\n      return done();\n    });\n\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\nconfig/env/\n subfolders\n#\n\n\nIn v0.10.x, we added the \nconfig/env\n folder (thanks to \n@clarkorz\n), where you can add config files that will be loaded only in the appropriate environment (e.g. \nconfig/env/production.js\n for production environment, \nconfig/env/development\n for development, etc.).  In v0.11.x we've added the ability to specify whole subfolders per-environment.  For example, \nall\n config files saved to the \nconfig/env/production\n will be loaded and merged on top of other configuration when the environment is set to \nproduction\n.  Note that if both a \nconfig/env/production\n folder and a \nconfig/env/production.js\n file are present, the \nconfig/env/production.js\n settings will take precedence.  And, as always, \nlocal.js\n is merged on top of all other files, and \n.sailsrc\n rules them all.\n\n\nQuestions?\n#\n\n\nAs always, if you run into issues upgrading, or if any of the notes above don't make sense, let us know and we'll do what we can to clarify.\n\n\nFinally, to those of you that have contributed to the project since the v0.10 release in August: we can't stress enough how much we value your continued support and encouragement.  There is a pretty massive stream of issues, pull requests, documentation tweaks, and questions, but it always helps to know that we're in this together :)\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n-\n@mikermcneil\n, \n@sgress454\n and \n@particlebanana",

The purpose of  onConnect  was always for optimizing performance (eliminating the need to do this initial extra round-trip with the server), yet its use can lead to confusion and race conditions. If you desperately need to eliminate the server roundtrip, you can bind a handler directly on  sails.io.on('connect', function (newlyConnectedSocket){})  in your bootstrap function ( config/bootstrap.js ). However, note that this is discouraged.  Unless you're facing  true  production performance issues, you should use the strategy mentioned above for your \"on connection\" logic (i.e. send an initial request from the client after the socket connects).

As you might already know, hooks are the lowest-level pluggable abstraction in Sails.  They allow authors to tap into the lift process, listen for events, inject custom \"shadow\" routes, and, in general, take advantage of raw access to the  sails  runtime.\nMost of the features you're familiar with in Sails have actually already been implemented as \"core\" hooks for over a year, including:   blueprints   (which provides the blueprint API)  sockets      (which provides socket.io integration)  grunt        (which provides Grunt integration)  orm          (which provides integration with the Waterline ORM, and imports your projects adapters, models, etc.)  http         (which provides an HTTP server)  and 16 others.

You will find that this version is mostly backwards compatible with Sails v0.11, however there are some major changes to \nsails.sockets.*\n methods which may or may not affect your app. Most of the migration guide below deals with those changes, so if you are upgrading an existing app from v0.11 and are using \nsails.sockets\n methods, please be sure and carefully read the information below in case it affects your app.  Other than that, running \nsails lift\n in an existing project should just work.\n\n\nThe sections below provide a high level overview of what's changed, major bug fixes, enhancements and new features, as well as a basic tutorial on how to upgrade your v0.11.x Sails app to v0.12.\n\n\nInstalling the update\n#\n\n\nRun the following command from the root of your Sails app:\n\n\nnpm install sails@0.12.0 --force --save\n\n\n\n\nThe \n--force\n flag will override the existing Sails dependency installed in your \nnode_modules/\n folder with Sails v0.12, and the \n--save\n flag will update your package.json file so that future npm installs will also use the new version.\n\n\nThings to do immediately after upgrading\n#\n\n\n\n\nIf your app uses the \nsocket.io-redis\n adapter, upgrade to at least version 1.0.0 (\nnpm install --save socket.io-redis@^1.0.0\n).\n\n\nIf your app is using the Sails socket client (e.g. \nassets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js\n) on the front end, also install the newest version (\nsails generate sails.io.js --force\n)\n\n\n\n\nOverview of changes in v0.12\n#\n\n\n\n\nFor a full list of changes, see the changelog file for \nSails\n, as well as those for \nWaterline\n, \nsails-hook-sockets\n and \nsails.io.js\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity enhancements: updated several dependencies with potential vulnerabilities\n\n\nReverse routing functionality is now built in to Sails core via the new \nsails.getRouteFor()\n and \nsails.getUrlFor()\n methods\n\n\nGenerally improved multi-node support (and therefore scalability) of low-level \nsails.socket.*\n methods, and made additional adjustments and improvements related to the latest socket.io upgrade.  Added a much tighter Redis integration that sits on top of \nsocket.io-redis\n, using a redis client to implement cross-server communication rather than an additional socket client.\n\n\nCleaned up the API for \nsails.socket.*\n methods, normalizing overloaded functions and deprecating methods which cause problems in multiserver deployments (more on that below).\n\n\nAdded a few brand new sails.sockets methods: \n.leaveAll()\n, \n.addRoomMembersToRooms()\n, and \n.removeRoomMembersFromRooms()\n\n\nsails.sockets.id()\n is now \nsails.sockets.getId()\n (backwards compatible w/ deprecation message)\n\n\nNew Sails apps are now generated with the updated version of \nsails.io.js\n (the JavaScript Sails socket client).  This upgrade bundles the latest version of \nsocket.io-client\n, as well as some more advanced functionality (including the ability to specify common headers for all virtual socket requests)\n\n\nUpgraded to latest trusted versions of \ngrunt-contrib-*\n dependencies (eliminates many NPM deprecation warnings and provides better error messages from NPM).\n\n\nIf you are using NPM v3, running \nsails new\n will now run \nnpm install\n instead of symlinking your new app's initial dependencies.  This is slower than you may be used to, but is a necessary change due to changes in the way NPM handles nested dependencies.  The core maintainers are \nworking on\n a better long-term solution, but in the mean time if you run \nsails new\n a lot and the slowdown is bugging you, consider temporarily downgrading to an earlier version of NPM (v2.x).  If the installed version of NPM is < version 3, Sails will continue to take advantage of the classic symlinking strategy.\n\n\n\n\nSocket Methods\n#\n\n\nWithout question, the biggest change in Sails v0.12 is to the API of the low-level \nsails.sockets\n methods exposed by the \nsockets\n hook.  In order to ensure that Sails apps perform flawlessly in a \nmulti-server (aka \"multi-node\" or \"clustered\") environment\n, several \nlow-level methods\n have been deprecated, and some new ones have been added.\n\n\nThe following \nsails.sockets\n methods have been deprecated:\n\n\n\n\n.emit()\n\n\n.id()\n (renamed to \n.getId()\n)\n\n\n.socketRooms()\n\n\n.rooms()\n\n\n.subscribers()\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using any of those methods in your app, they will still work in v0.12 but \nyou should replace them as soon as possible\n as they may be removed from Sails in the next version.  See the individual doc pages for each method for more information.\n\n\nResourceful PubSub Methods\n#\n\n\nThe \n.subscribers()\n resourceful pubsub method has been deprecated for the same reasons as \nsails.sockets.subscribers()\n.  Follow the guidelines in the docs for replacing this method if you are using it in your code.\n\n\nWaterline (ORM) Updates\n#\n\n\nSails v0.12 comes with the latest version of the Waterline ORM (v0.11.0).  There are two API changes to be aware of:\n\n\n.save()\n no longer provides a second argument to its callback\n#\n\n\nThe callback to the \n.save()\n instance method no longer receives a second argument.  While convenient, the requirement of providing this second argument made \n.save()\n less performant, especially for apps working with millions of records.  This change resolves those issues by eliminating the need to build redundant queries, and preventing your database from having to process them.\n\n\nIf there are places in your app where you have code like this:\n\n\nsierra.save(function (err, modifiedSierra){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n\nsierra.save(function (err){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nCustom column/field names for built-in timestamps\n#\n\n\nYou can now configure a custom column name (i.e. field name for Mongo/Redis folks) for the built-in \ncreatedAt\n and \nupdatedAt\n attributes.  In the past, the top-level \nautoCreatedAt\n and \nautoUpdatedAt\n model settings could be specified as \nfalse\n to disable the automatic injection of \ncreatedAt\n and \nupdatedAt\n altogether.  That \nstill works as it always has\n, but now you can also specify string values for one or both of these settings instead.  If a string is specified, it will be understood as the custom column (/field) name to use for the automatic timestamp.\n\n\n{\n  attributes: {},\n  autoCreatedAt: 'my_cool_created_when_timestamp',\n  autoUpdatedAt: 'my_cool_updated_at_timestamp'\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you were using the \nworkaround suggested by @sgress454 here\n, you may want to take advantage of this simpler approach instead.\n\n\nSQL Adapter Performance\n#\n\n\nSails-PostgreSQL\n and \nSails-MySQL\n recieved patch updates that significantly improved performance when populating associations. Thanks to \n@jianpingw\n for digging into the source and finding a bug that was processing database records too many times. If you are using either of these adapters, upgrading to \nsails-postgresql@0.11.1\n or \nsails-mysql@0.11.3\n will give you a significant performance boost.\n\n\nContributing\n#\n\n\nWhile not technically part of the release, Sails v0.12 is accompanied by some major improvements to the tools and resources available to contributors.  More core hooks are now fully documented (\ncontrollers\n|\ngrunt\n|\nlogger\n|\ncors\n|\nresponses\n|\norm\n), and the team has put together a \nCode of Conduct\n for contributing to the Sails project.\n\n\nThe biggest change for contributors is the \nupdated contribution guide\n, which contains the new, streamlined process for feature/enhancement proposals and for merging features, enhancements, and patches into core.  As the Sails framework has grown (both the code base and the user base), it's become necessary to establish clearer processes for how issue contributions, code contributions, and contributions to the documentation are reviewed and merged.\n\n\nDocumentation\n#\n\n\nThis release also comes with a deep clean of the official reference documentation, and some minor usability improvements to the online docs at \nhttp://sailsjs.org/documentation\n. The entire Sails website is now available in \nJapanese\n, and four other \ntranslation projects\n are underway for Korean, Brazillian Portugese, Taiwanese Mandarin, and Spanish.\n\n\nIn addition, the Sails.js project (finally) has an \nofficial blog\n.  The Sails.js blog is the new source for all longform updates and announcements about Sails, as well as for our related projects like Waterline, Skipper and the machine specification.\n\n\nNeed Help?\n#\n\n\nIf you run into an unexpected issue upgrading your Sails app to v0.12.0, please review our contribution guide and \nsubmit an issue in the Sails GitHub repo\n.",

            "text": "For a full list of changes, see the changelog file for  Sails , as well as those for  Waterline ,  sails-hook-sockets  and  sails.io.js .    Security enhancements: updated several dependencies with potential vulnerabilities  Reverse routing functionality is now built in to Sails core via the new  sails.getRouteFor()  and  sails.getUrlFor()  methods  Generally improved multi-node support (and therefore scalability) of low-level  sails.socket.*  methods, and made additional adjustments and improvements related to the latest socket.io upgrade.  Added a much tighter Redis integration that sits on top of  socket.io-redis , using a redis client to implement cross-server communication rather than an additional socket client.  Cleaned up the API for  sails.socket.*  methods, normalizing overloaded functions and deprecating methods which cause problems in multiserver deployments (more on that below).  Added a few brand new sails.sockets methods:  .leaveAll() ,  .addRoomMembersToRooms() , and  .removeRoomMembersFromRooms()  sails.sockets.id()  is now  sails.sockets.getId()  (backwards compatible w/ deprecation message)  New Sails apps are now generated with the updated version of  sails.io.js  (the JavaScript Sails socket client).  This upgrade bundles the latest version of  socket.io-client , as well as some more advanced functionality (including the ability to specify common headers for all virtual socket requests)  Upgraded to latest trusted versions of  grunt-contrib-*  dependencies (eliminates many NPM deprecation warnings and provides better error messages from NPM).  If you are using NPM v3, running  sails new  will now run  npm install  instead of symlinking your new app's initial dependencies.  This is slower than you may be used to, but is a necessary change due to changes in the way NPM handles nested dependencies.  The core maintainers are  working on  a better long-term solution, but in the mean time if you run  sails new  a lot and the slowdown is bugging you, consider temporarily downgrading to an earlier version of NPM (v2.x).  If the installed version of NPM is < version 3, Sails will continue to take advantage of the classic symlinking strategy.",

            "text": "Without question, the biggest change in Sails v0.12 is to the API of the low-level  sails.sockets  methods exposed by the  sockets  hook.  In order to ensure that Sails apps perform flawlessly in a  multi-server (aka \"multi-node\" or \"clustered\") environment , several  low-level methods  have been deprecated, and some new ones have been added.  The following  sails.sockets  methods have been deprecated:   .emit()  .id()  (renamed to  .getId() )  .socketRooms()  .rooms()  .subscribers()   If you are using any of those methods in your app, they will still work in v0.12 but  you should replace them as soon as possible  as they may be removed from Sails in the next version.  See the individual doc pages for each method for more information.",

While convenient, the requirement of providing this second argument made  .save()  less performant, especially for apps working with millions of records.  This change resolves those issues by eliminating the need to build redundant queries, and preventing your database from having to process them.  If there are places in your app where you have code like this:  sierra.save(function (err, modifiedSierra){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});  You should replace it with:  sierra.save(function (err){\n  if (err) { /* ... */  return; }\n\n  // ...\n});",

In the past, the top-level  autoCreatedAt  and  autoUpdatedAt  model settings could be specified as  false  to disable the automatic injection of  createdAt  and  updatedAt  altogether.  That  still works as it always has , but now you can also specify string values for one or both of these settings instead.  If a string is specified, it will be understood as the custom column (/field) name to use for the automatic timestamp.  {\n  attributes: {},\n  autoCreatedAt: 'my_cool_created_when_timestamp',\n  autoUpdatedAt: 'my_cool_updated_at_timestamp'\n}  If you were using the  workaround suggested by @sgress454 here , you may want to take advantage of this simpler approach instead.",

It now does.\n+ Config: _ and async no longer have to be global (but they are by default) They are configurable with  sails.config.globals._  and  sails.config.globals.async  (thanks  @particlebanana !)\n+ New sails project can now be created in the current dir with  sails new .  (thanks  @collinwren !)\n+ More tests (thanks  @collinwren  and  @benrudolph )\n+ Travis CI integration (thanks  @collinwren !)",

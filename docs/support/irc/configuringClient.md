# Setting Up Your Client
## Registering On Freenode
Our chat room is on the Freenode network.  Freenode does not require that you register your `nick` name.  You do have the option to though.  If you want to do this, read about how to do it [on the freenode website](https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering)

## Getting on Freenode

Each IRC Client is a little different to configure.  All of the ones we have recommended have very straight forward configuration process.  If your client provides a list of available servers, look for the one called Freenode.

Make sure to put in a `nick` to go by.

Upon connecting to the Freenode network, join us by typing `/join #sailsjs`.

If you registered a nick, you can identify yourself with `/msg nickserv identify <password>`

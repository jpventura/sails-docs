### Notes
> - This README file **is not compiled to HTML** for the website.  It is just here to explain what you're looking at.
> - Depending on what branch of `sails-docs` you are currently viewing, the domain may vary.  Documentation pages in this section may actually be for a past version of Sails (e.g. the `0.11` branch compiles to http://0.11.sailsjs.org) or for an upcoming release (e.g. the branch for the upcoming release of Sails compiles to http://next.sailsjs.org).  See the top-level README file in the `sails-docs` repo for information about working with the markdown files in this repo, and to understand the branching/versioning strategy.

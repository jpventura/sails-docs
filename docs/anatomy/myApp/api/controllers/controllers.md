# myApp/api/controllers
### Purpose
This is the directory that holds your controllers.  In Sails, controllers are javascript files that contain logic for interacting with models and rendering appropriate views to the client.

When you call `sails generate api cats` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Sails will generate the file `myApp/api/controllers/CatsController.js` along with a matching model.

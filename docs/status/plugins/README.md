# Plugins

There are currently three types of plugins in Sails:

+ **Generators** - for adding and overriding functionality in the Sails CLI
+ **Adapters** - for integrating Waterline (Sails' ORM) with new data sources, including databases, APIs, or even hardware.
+ **Hooks** - for overriding or injecting new low-level functionality in the Sails runtime

## API Status

> ##### Stability: [1-2](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index) - Varies
>
> The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable.

# Remove (Blueprint)

Remove a foreign record (e.g. a comment) from one of this record's collection associations (e.g. "comments").

```
DELETE /:model/:id/:association/:fk
```

This action removes a reference to some other record (the "foreign" record) from a collection attribute of this record (the "primary" record).  Note that this does not actually destroy the foreign record-- it just removes it.

+ If the foreign record does not exist, it is created first.
+ If the collection doesn't contain a reference to the foreign record, this action will be ignored.
+ If the association is 2-way (i.e. reflexive, with "via" on both sides) the association on the foreign record will also be updated.

### Parameters

 Parameter                          | Type                                    | Details
:---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------
 model | ((string)) | The [identity](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/model-settings#?identity) of the containing model for the parent record.<br/><br/>e.g. `'store'` (in `/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7`)
 id | ((string)) | The desired target record's primary key value<br/><br/>e.g. `'16'` (in `/store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7`)
 association       | ((string))                              | The name of the collection association<br/><br/>e.g. `'employeesOfTheMonth'`
 fk  | ((string))    | The id of the foreign record to remove from the collection association.<br/><br/>e.g. `7`
 _callback_                         | ((string))                              | If specified, a JSONP response will be sent (instead of JSON). This is the name of the client-side javascript function to call, passing results as the first (and only) argument<br/> <br/> e.g. `?callback=myJSONPHandlerFn`


### Example

Say you're building an app for a small chain of grocery stores.  Each store has a giant television screen that displays the current "Employee of the Month" at that store, so that customers and team members see it when they walk in the door.  In order to be sure it is up to date, you build a scheduled job (e.g. using [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)) that runs on the first day of every month to change the "Employees of the Month" for each store in our system.

Let's say that, as a part of this scheduled job, we send a request to remove remove Dolly (employee #7) from the `employeesOfTheMonth` list of store #16:

```
DELETE /store/16/employeesOfTheMonth/7
```

##### Expected Response

```json
{
  "id": 16,
  "name": "Parmer and N. Lamar",
  "createdAt": "2014-08-03T01:16:35.440Z",
  "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T01:51:41.567Z",
  "employeesOfTheMonth": []
}
```


### Notes

> + If you'd like to spend some more time with Dolly, a more detailed walkthrough for the example above is available [here](https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/e5a20b03be5aa4e0459b).
> + This action is for dealing with _plural_ ("collection") associations.  If you want to set or unset a _singular_ ("model") association, just use [update](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/blueprint-api/Update.html) and set the model association to the id of the new foreign record (or `null` to clear the association).
